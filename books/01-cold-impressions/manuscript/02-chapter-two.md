# Chapter Two
**Thursday Morning**

Brandon Gray had been awake since four-thirty. Not unusual. Sleep came in fragments on cases like this—two hours, then awake, then another hour if he was lucky. He'd learned to work with it rather than fight it.

By six he was dressed and downstairs in the Quality Inn's breakfast area, a corner room off the lobby with industrial carpet and fluorescent lights that hummed at a frequency most people didn't notice. Brandon noticed. He'd positioned himself at a table in the back corner, away from the windows, with a clear view of the entrance and the coffee station.

The case files were spread across the table in front of him, arranged in an order that would look haphazard to anyone else. Witness statements on the left, organized by proximity to the scene. Security footage stills in the center, sequenced by timestamp. Victimology on the right—Sarah Carpenter's life in documents and photographs.

He had a cup of black coffee cooling in front of him. It was surprisingly good quality for a hotel, some regional brand.

Three other people occupied the breakfast area. An older couple near the waffle maker, talking quietly about their grandson's football game. A man in his forties at a table by the window, reading the local newspaper while eating a bagel. The man wore no wedding ring but had a tan line that suggested there should be one there. Recent divorce, or possibly a man looking to cheat while on the road.

Brandon returned his attention to the files. Sarah Carpenter's face looked up at him from her library ID photo—twenty-two, dark blonde hair pulled back, blue eyes, the kind of smile that made you want to smile back. She'd started at the Blackburn Public Library three years ago, right after high school. Circulation desk, children's programs, whatever needed doing. Her supervisor called her reliable. Her coworker called her sweet. Her mother called her gone.

The phone records showed her last three calls: AAA at 8:12 PM, her mother at 8:14 PM, Jessica Holt at 8:17 PM. The third call had gone to voicemail. The transcript of the recovered message was in the file. *Hey Jess, it's me. My car died at the Crossroads and I'm waiting for a tow but it's going to be like an hour and I'm freezing out here. Any chance you could—*

The message cut off mid-sentence. Not because she'd hung up. Because something had interrupted her.

Someone.

Brandon picked up his coffee. It had gone lukewarm. He drank it anyway.

He thought about the moments before an abduction. The victim's awareness shifting from mundane annoyance to confusion to fear. That transition was usually fast—split second, not seconds. But Sarah had known her abductor. That changed the timeline. Extended it. She'd had time to realize something was wrong before it was too late to run.

The physiological response to that realization: elevated heart rate, adrenaline spike, pupils dilating, time distortion. Some victims later reported those seconds feeling like minutes. The brain processing threat assessment at accelerated speed. Fight, flight, or freeze.

Sarah had frozen. Or tried to talk her way out. The purse left behind suggested she hadn't run. The absence of blood at the scene suggested no immediate violence...meant she hadn't fought. She'd gone with him. Maybe thinking she still had a chance to de-escalate. To reason with someone she knew.

She'd been wrong.

Brandon set the coffee down and pulled out his phone. He opened the photos he'd taken yesterday at the Crossroads. The payphone. The angle from the mini-mart door. The spot where Sarah's car had been parked.

He'd stood there for ninety minutes, not moving, barely breathing, letting the scene settle in his mind the way it always did. Not intuition, exactly. Just intense focus. Most people looked at crime scenes and cataloged evidence. Brandon tried to reconstruct the event itself—imagining movements, psychology, the sequence of actions that left the traces behind.

In his mind, he could picture Sarah standing by the phone, receiver to her ear, shifting her weight from foot to foot because it had been a chilly spring evening and she was impatient. The truck pulling in, dark paint catching the security light. The driver's door opening, someone stepping out. Someone Sarah recognized.

Her body language changed. Still relaxed, but curious. A small wave, maybe. A question forming.

Then the shift. Subtle at first. Her posture straightening. The hand not holding the phone moving slightly away from her body—unconscious preparation to defend herself or create distance.

But by then it would have been already too late.

"You're up early."

Brandon looked up. Matt stood by the table, holding a paper plate with a waffle, some fruit, and three slices of bacon. He'd showered and shaved. His shirt was pressed, sleeves rolled evenly. Even at six-thirty in the morning, Matt Ellis looked like an FBI recruitment poster.

"Couldn't sleep," Brandon said.

Matt sat down across from him, surveying the spread of files. "Learn anything new?"

"Sarah was a creature of habit. Same route home every day. Same stop at the Crossroads for gas every Thursday after her shift. She was predictable."

"Which made her easy to watch."

"And easy to intercept." Brandon gathered the files into a stack, his system disrupted now that Matt was there. "If he tampered with her car, he did it while she was at the library. That's a narrow window. Her shift ended at eight. She left by eight-oh-five according to her coworker. Car was parked in the employee lot behind the building. He would've have had to do it after 7pm when early staff ended their day. He wouldn't have wanted to be seen."

"So he knew the library's layout. Knew where employees parked."

"Wouldn't be hard if he'd been watching Sarah." Brandon closed the last file. "We need to talk to her co-workers. See who paid attention to her. Who asked questions."

Matt cut into his waffle. "That's the plan. Library opens at ten. I talked to the head librarian yesterday. She said she'd make time for us."

Brandon nodded. He checked his watch. Seven forty-three. Two hours and seventeen minutes until the library opened. He could review the files again. Cross-reference the truck registrations with library patron records, see if any names overlapped. Start building a geographic profile of the suspect based on the abduction site and—

"You should eat something," Matt said.

Brandon looked at him.

"You didn't eat much at dinner last night. And you're going to need energy for interviews." Matt gestured toward the breakfast spread. "At least grab a banana or something."

Brandon stood. Matt was right—he often forgot to eat when he was working. His body didn't send the same hunger signals other people seemed to get. He'd go hours without noticing, then feel lightheaded and realize he'd skipped meals.

He walked to the breakfast bar and picked up a banana, a bagel, and a container of cream cheese. When he returned to the table, Matt had moved some of the files aside to make room.

They sat in silence for a few minutes. The older couple left, waving goodbye to the front desk clerk. The man by the window remained. He was focused on the screen of his phone, probably reading a text message. Brandon watched him peripherally. The way he hunched over the screen. The tension in his shoulders. Whatever he was reading wasn't good news.

"You mentioned Missouri last night," Matt said quietly. "Ashford."

Brandon peeled the banana. "Yeah."

"Want to talk about it?"

"Not much to talk about. Unsolved abduction. Twenty-one years old."

"Twenty-one years is a long time to remember a case you were far too young to have worked."

Brandon took a bite of banana. Chewed. Swallowed. "Some cases stick with you."

Matt waited, but Brandon didn't elaborate. After a moment, Matt returned to his waffle. He knew when to push and when to let something sit. Brandon appreciated that. It was one of the things that made him a good partner.

Brandon finished the banana and prepared his bagel. The cream cheese was strawberry. Too sweet, but the sugar would give him energy. He ate it mechanically while thinking about the library. Small town facility, probably built in the early 1900s. Carnegie library if he had to guess, based on the address and the architectural style common to that era. Limited staff. Everyone would know everyone. If someone had been paying unusual attention to Sarah, her coworkers would have noticed.

Unless the person had been careful. Unless they'd blended in so well that their attention seemed normal until it was too late.

"I'm driving this morning," Brandon said.

Matt looked up. "Yeah?"

"I want to take the route Sarah would have taken. Thorndale to the library in Blackburn then to the Crossroads. See what's between."

"Good idea."

They finished breakfast and went back to their rooms to gather their things. Brandon brushed his teeth, checked that his badge and weapon were secure, and grabbed his jacket. The gray oxford shirt from yesterday was wrinkled beyond saving. He'd brought a spare—light blue, still wrinkled but less noticeably. He tucked it in only on the right for access to his weapon.

At seven-fifteen they met at the car. Brandon took the driver's seat. Matt handed him a travel mug of coffee from the lobby.

"You didn't have to do that," Brandon said.

"I know."

Brandon pulled out of the parking lot and headed south on Route 39 toward Blackburn. The morning was overcast, the sky a uniform gray that suggested rain later. The temperature had dropped overnight. Frost edged the grass along the roadside.

The library was off the main drag in Blackburn on a little commercial street named Jackson. The drive took twelve minutes. Brandon timed it. It would've taken Sarah a little bit longer coming from her house in Thorndale. Probably closer to seventeen minutes. The library sat on Main Street, a red brick building with white columns and a copper-roofed dome that had turned green with age. A Carnegie library, as he'd suspected. Built 1912 according to the cornerstone.

He parked on the street and sat for a moment, looking at the building. Sarah had worked here. Had climbed these steps every day. Had made the coffee in the break room. Had shelved books and helped patrons and planned children's story time.

She'd worked the late shift, until closing every Thursday evening, Had driven home, stopping at the Crossroads for gas because it was on her way and the prices were a few cents cheaper than the station in town.

Until one Thursday when her car wouldn't start.

"We've got an hour and a half," Matt said. "Want to walk the route?"

Brandon nodded. They got out of the car and walked around to the back of the library. The employee parking lot was small—six spaces, all empty now. A dumpster sat in the far corner. A security light on a pole, currently off. No cameras visible.

"He could have worked on her car here without being seen," Matt said. "Especially if he did it after dark."

"She worked until eight. Light would have been fading after seven that time of year." Brandon walked to the middle of the lot, turned in a slow circle. Trees lined the back of the property, creating a natural screen from the residential street beyond. "No witnesses. No cameras. If he knew she parked here, this would be the place."

They walked back around to the front. Jackson Street was starting to wake up—a few cars, some early morning shoppers walking the cracked sidewalk, a woman opening the bakery three doors down. The smell of fresh bread drifted on the cold air.

Brandon and Matt walked south, following the route Sarah would have driven. Past the elementary school. Past the post office. At the edge of town, Jackson Street intersected Main Street which became Route 39 once you were out of town. They stopped at the town limit sign.

"Three miles to the Crossroads from here," Matt said. "Maybe four. Farm fields on both sides. A few scattered houses. No businesses."

Brandon looked south down the empty highway. "Isolated. If he'd taken her somewhere between here and there, no one would have seen."

"But he took her from the Crossroads. In front of a witness, even if that witness was inside."

"Because that's where he knew she'd be stopped. Where she'd be vulnerable." Brandon turned back toward town. "It wasn't about isolation. It was about control. He engineered the situation so she'd have to stop exactly where he wanted her."

They walked back to the library. By the time they returned, it was nine-fifty. A few cars had filled the parking lot. Lights were on inside the building.

Matt checked his watch. "Ten minutes."

Brandon sat on the front steps. The stone was cold through his pants. He watched a school bus drive past, yellow against the gray morning. A dog barked somewhere nearby. Normal sounds in a normal town where something terrible had happened.

At ten o'clock exactly, they climbed the steps and entered the library.

The interior carried the unmistakable smell of old books. Wooden floors, high ceilings, tall frosted glass windows that let in weak daylight. The circulation desk stood directly ahead. To the left, rows of stacks. To the right, a reading area with tables and chairs. A children's section in the back corner, colorful and inviting.

And on the wall near the entrance, a memorial.

Brandon stopped. He hadn't expected this, though he should have. Small towns remembered their own.

A bulletin board with a poster-sized photo of Sarah Carpenter in the center. Candid shot, not the formal ID photo he'd seen in the file. She was laughing at something off-camera, her whole face lit up. Around the photo, people had pinned notes and cards and flowers that had been pressed flat under glass. A small table beneath the board held a condolence book and a jar with fresh carnations.

Brandon approached slowly. Matt hung back, giving him space.

The notes were what you'd expect. *We miss you. You were the best. Heaven gained an angel. Thinking of you always.* Most were dated from April and May, written in the immediate aftermath of her disappearance. A few from summer. One from August.

And one from September. Last month.

Brandon leaned closer. The handwriting was different from the others—smaller, tighter, written with a ballpoint pen instead of marker. Just three words: *I'm so sorry.*

No signature.

The note had been secured with heavy-duty packing tape, the edges pressed flat against the bulletin board. Brandon pulled his phone out with one hand and fished a small switchblade from the other. He pressed the thumb slide and the blade snapped open. Using the tip carefully, he worked under the edge of the tape, lifting it just enough to see if anything was written on the back of the note.

Nothing. Just the three words on the front.

He took a photo of the note, then gently pressed the tape back down. The blade closed with another click as he pocketed the knife.

Then he opened the condolence book. More of the same—messages of grief and remembrance, names he didn't recognize but may need to cross-reference later. Teachers. Classmates. Neighbors. The whole town had signed this book.

He flipped through the pages slowly. Most entries from April. A few scattered through the summer. And on the last page with writing, another unsigned entry: *I think about you every day. I'm sorry I couldn't help you.*

Different handwriting than the note on the board. Or perhaps the same person trying to disguise it.

Brandon photographed this page too.

"Can I help you gentlemen?"

He turned. A woman stood behind the circulation desk—late fifties, gray hair cut short, tall for a woman, almost six feet. She wore a cardigan over a floral dress. Her expression was polite but guarded.

Matt stepped forward, showing his badge. "Special Agents Ellis and Gray, FBI. We called earlier. You must be Mrs. Holcomb."

"Patricia, please." She came around the desk, shaking their hands. Her grip was firm, her palm warm. "I have a meeting room in back where we can talk privately."

Brandon glanced back at the memorial one more time before following her.

The meeting room was small—just a table with six chairs, a whiteboard on one wall, and a window that looked out onto the employee parking lot. Patricia gestured for them to sit and closed the door.

"I've been expecting you," she said, settling into a chair across from them. "Sheriff Garrett called yesterday, said the FBI was taking a fresh look at Sarah's case. I'll help however I can, though I don't know what more I can tell you than I told the deputies last spring."

Matt pulled out a notebook. "We appreciate that. Sometimes a fresh perspective can reveal new details. Can you tell us about Sarah? What kind of employee was she?"

Patricia's expression softened. "She was wonderful. Truly. Started here right out of high school, and I honestly don't know what we would have done without her. She was good with the patrons, especially the children. Patient. Kind. Always had time for people."

"What were her responsibilities?" Brandon asked.

"She worked the circulation desk mostly. Checking books in and out, helping people find materials, managing the computer stations. She also ran our children's programs—story time on Saturday mornings, the summer reading club. And she helped with shelving and processing new arrivals."

"So she interacted with a lot of people."

"Every day. We're a small library, but many of the smaller towns in the county don't have one. We stay busy. People come in for books, internet access, newspapers. Sarah knew most of the regulars by name."

Brandon leaned forward slightly. "Did anyone pay unusual attention to her? Ask personal questions, try to get to know her outside of work?"

Patricia hesitated. Just a fraction of a second, but Brandon caught it.

"There was someone," he said.

She sighed. "Yes. Though I don't know if it means anything. We get all kinds here—lonely people looking for conversation, people who develop... attachments to staff members. It's usually harmless."

"But you noticed something about this person."

"I noticed Sarah finding excuses to be in the back when he came in. That's not like her. She was professional. She didn't avoid patrons." Patricia folded her hands on the table. "His name is Dale Kovacs. He's been coming here for years, always friendly, never caused problems. But about three months before Sarah disappeared, he started coming in more often. And he'd always end up at the circulation desk when Sarah was working."

Matt was writing. "What kind of interactions did they have?"

"Normal ones, on the surface. He'd check out books, chat about the weather, ask for recommendations. But Sarah mentioned to me once that he made her uncomfortable. She couldn't explain why. Just a feeling."

"Did she report it?" Brandon asked.

"To me, yes. I kept an eye on him after that, but I never saw him do anything inappropriate. He was just... there. Often. And he asked questions."

"What kind of questions?"

"About Sarah's schedule. Whether she'd be working on a particular day. Whether any male patrons had been showing interest in her. That sort of thing." Patricia's jaw tightened. "I should have done more. Should have talked to him directly, or asked him to use a different library. But I didn't want to make accusations if nothing was actually wrong. Small town—you have to be careful about rumors."

"You couldn't have known," Matt said gently.

Brandon wasn't listening. His attention had shifted to the window behind Patricia. The employee parking lot. The trees. The absence of security cameras.

"Does Dale Kovacs drive a truck?" he asked.

Patricia blinked. "I... yes, I think so. An older model, I believe. I don't really pay attention to cars."

"When was the last time he came in?"

"I believe I saw him recently, this week. Monday...or maybe Tuesday."

Matt and Brandon exchanged a glance.

"Is he here now?" Brandon asked.

"I'm not sure. He is often here in the mornings. Let me check the system." Patricia stood and walked to the door. "I'll be right back."

When she was gone, Matt leaned closer. "Kovacs fits the profile. Knew Sarah, made her uncomfortable, drives an older truck."

"And he's been in recently," Brandon added. "After the case was reopened."

"Returning to follow the investigation?"

"Or feeling guilty."

Patricia returned a moment later. "He was here two days ago. Checked out three books. I have his information pulled up if you need it."

They followed her to the circulation desk. She turned the computer monitor so they could see. Dale Kovacs, 46, address on County Road 275. A small photo showed a man with plain features, receding brown hair, the kind of face that would disappear in a crowd. Current checkouts: *The Complete Guide to Tracking and Stalking*, *Topographical Maps of Southern Indiana*, and *Wilderness Survival Skills*.

Brandon felt something cold settle in his stomach.

"Can we get a copy of his borrowing history?" Matt asked. "Going back to the beginning of this year."

"I'll print it for you."

While Patricia worked the printer, Brandon scanned the library. A few patrons browsed the stacks. An middle-aged woman read a romance novel in a comfy chair. Two elderly men sat facing each other intently over a game of chess. And in the far corner, at one of the public computer terminals— 

The man from the photo. Dale Kovacs.

Brandon's hand moved to Matt's arm, a brief touch. Matt followed his gaze.

Kovacs sat with his back to them, hunched over the screen, wearing a gray hoodie and jeans. Brown hair, receding at the temples. Medium build. From this distance, he looked like anyone. Everyone. Invisible in his ordinariness.

But something was wrong. Brandon couldn't articulate it yet, but the feeling was there—the same instinct that had guided him through dozens of cases. The sense that he was looking at someone who didn't fit quite right in his own skin.

Patricia handed Matt the printout. "Anything else I can do for you?"

"Is there anyone else we should talk to? Other staff who knew Sarah?"

"Amy Chen. She worked the same shifts as Sarah sometimes. They were friendly. She's here today—comes in at eleven."

Brandon was still watching Kovacs. "Thank you, Mrs. Holcomb. We'll wait for Amy."

Patricia returned to her desk. Matt moved closer to Brandon.

"That's him?"

"Yes."

"Want to approach now?"

Brandon shook his head slightly. "Not yet. Let's see what he does."

They moved to the reading area, taking seats at a table with a clear sightline to the computer terminals. Brandon picked up a newspaper from the rack, held it open like he was reading. Matt pored over the printout of Kovacs's borrowing history.

Kovacs worked at the computer for another ten minutes. Brandon watched his posture, his movements. The way he hunched forward, shoulders tense. The way his fingers moved across the keyboard—fast, confident. He was searching for something. Or monitoring something.

At ten-forty, Kovacs stood. He logged off the computer and walked toward the circulation desk.

Brandon lowered the newspaper slightly. Now he could see Kovacs's face.

Clean-shaven. Plain features. Nothing remarkable. The kind of face you'd forget five minutes after seeing it.

Except for the eyes. Even from across the room, Brandon could see the way Kovacs looked at Patricia—too direct, too focused. Like he was cataloging her responses, analyzing her body language.

Kovacs said something. Patricia smiled politely and scanned his library card. She handed him a slip of paper—a hold notification, probably. Kovacs thanked her and turned toward the door.

He saw Brandon and Matt.

Just a glance, nothing more. But Brandon saw the recognition flicker across his face. Not recognition of them specifically—they'd never met. Recognition of what they were. Law enforcement. Investigators.

Kovacs's expression didn't change. He walked past their table, nodded politely, and continued toward the exit.

Brandon stood and walked to the window. He watched Kovacs walk to a truck parked on the side street. A late nineties model, dark blue Silverado. A match for what the security footage had shown.

Kovacs climbed in, started the engine, and drove away.

Matt stood beside Brandon. "What do you think?"

"There's something not right about him."

"Like what?"

"I don't know yet." Brandon pulled out his notebook and jotted down a note: *Dale Kovacs - watch him*.

"He was in the library the day Sarah disappeared," Matt replied. "He checked out a book at six fifty-eight PM."

"What book?"

"A James Patterson novel."

A woman's voice behind them: "Can I help you find something?"

They turned. A young Asian woman stood there, mid-twenties, wearing a library staff badge. Amy Chen.

"We're with the FBI," Matt said, showing his badge. "We'd like to ask you some questions about Sarah Carpenter."

Amy's expression crumbled. "Oh. Okay. Yes, of course."

Patricia materialized from somewhere. "You can use the meeting room again."

They followed Amy back to the small room. She sat heavily in a chair, her hands twisting in her lap. Brandon noticed the way she wouldn't make eye contact, the way her shoulders curved inward. Grief, yes. But also guilt.

Matt took the lead. "How long did you work with Sarah?"

"Two years. Since I started here after college." Amy's voice was quiet. "We worked a lot of the same shifts. We weren't best friends or anything, but we were friendly."

"Did she mention anyone making her uncomfortable? Anyone who paid too much attention to her?"

Amy nodded. "There was a guy. Dale something. He came in a lot, and Sarah said he gave her weird vibes. She couldn't explain why. Just that something felt off about him."

"Did you ever interact with him?"

"A few times. He seemed normal to me. Polite, quiet. But Sarah had good instincts about people." Amy's eyes filled. "I should have paid more attention. Should have... I don't know. Been there more."

"This isn't your fault," Matt said.

"Everyone keeps saying that. But the last time I saw her, she asked if I wanted to get dinner after work that Thursday. And I said no because I had a date. If I'd said yes, if I'd been with her, maybe—"

"You couldn't have known," Brandon said. His voice was quiet but firm. "The person responsible is the only one at fault."

Amy wiped her eyes. "I just want someone to find her. To bring her home. Her mom—Mrs. Carpenter—she just wants to know what happened. That's all."

Brandon thought about the memorial board. The unsigned notes. The weight of unanswered questions.

"Did Sarah ever mention wanting to leave Thorndale?" he asked. "Going back to school, moving away?"

Amy looked up, surprised. "Yeah. She'd applied to Indiana State in Terre Haute for the fall semester. She wanted to study English first, then a master's in library science, maybe become a librarian at a university somewhere. She'd been saving up for it. She just needed more time."

Time she never got.

They talked for another twenty minutes. Amy provided names of other regulars, described Sarah's routine, confirmed that Dale Kovacs had been increasingly present in the months before the abduction. When they were done, Amy stood slowly.

"Do you think you'll find her?" she asked.

Matt's expression was kind but honest. "We're going to try."

After Amy left, Brandon and Matt sat in silence for a moment.

"Right now, Kovacs is our primary suspect," Matt said. "Everything points to him."

"Too much points to him." Brandon stared at the window. "It's too neat."

"Sometimes it is neat. Sometimes the obvious answer is the right answer."

"Maybe." Brandon stood and walked to the window. The parking lot was empty except for staff vehicles. Beyond the trees, he could see a sliver of the residential street. Normal houses. Normal lives.

"I want to see his property," Brandon said. "County Road 275. See if anything stands out."

"We'll need a warrant to search."

"I don't want to search. Just drive by. Look."

Matt checked his watch. "It's eleven-thirty. We should check in with the sheriff, see if they've made any progress on the truck owner list."

Brandon nodded but didn't move from the window. His mind was working through the timeline, the evidence, the psychology. Dale Kovacs fit the profile. Made Sarah uncomfortable. Drove the right truck. Had been here that day. Had the knowledge to tamper with her car. Asked questions about her. Returned to the library after the case was reopened.

But something was wrong. Some piece didn't fit.

"The memorial," Brandon said suddenly. "The unsigned notes."

"You think Kovacs wrote them?"

"Maybe. He wasn't secretive about his interest in Sarah. They're obviously from someone who feels guilty." He turned to face Matt. "Someone who knew something and didn't speak up. Or helped. Maybe that's Kovacs, maybe it isn't."

"An accomplice?"

"Or a witness who kept quiet."

They left the meeting room and walked back through the library. Brandon paused again at Sarah's memorial. The smiling photo. The messages from people who missed her. The flowers that someone kept fresh.

He took out his phone and photographed the entire board, zooming in on each note, each card, each detail.

When he stepped back, Matt was watching him.

"You okay?"

Brandon looked at his partner. Matt's expression held genuine concern. After three years working together, Matt had learned to read his moods, his silences, his withdrawal into himself when a case hit too close.

"I will be," Brandon said. "When we solve it."

They walked outside into the cold morning. The sky had darkened. Rain was coming.

Brandon stood on the library steps and looked south down Main Street, toward Route 39, toward the Crossroads three miles away. He thought about Sarah Carpenter making this drive every Thursday, her routine so predictable that someone had learned it, studied it, exploited it.

He thought about Missouri. About a payphone and a boyfriend who couldn't get there in time. About an ten-year-old boy who didn't understand why his big brother wouldn't talk about that night.

He thought about all the people who disappeared and never came home.

"Let's go," he said. "I want to drive the route to the Crossroads then see where Kovacs lives."

They got in the car. Brandon drove, his hands steady on the wheel, his mind already mapping the route, calculating distances, imagining scenarios.

Somewhere in this small town, Sarah Carpenter's body was waiting to be found.

And somewhere in this small town, Dale Kovacs was waiting too.

Waiting to see if they'd figure it out in time.
