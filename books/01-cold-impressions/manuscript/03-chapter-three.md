# Chapter Three
**Thursday Late Morning**

Matt drove this time. Brandon sat in the passenger seat with his phone out, studying the satellite view of Dale Kovacs's property on Google Maps. County Road 275 ran east-west about four miles south of Thorndale, cutting through farmland and scattered residential plots. Kovacs's address put him two miles from the nearest neighbor.

"Twelve acres," Brandon said, zooming in on the image. "House, barn, what looks like a garage or workshop. Heavily wooded on the north side."

Matt kept his eyes on the road. They'd left the library twenty minutes ago. The sky had darkened further, and the first drops of rain hit the windshield. "We're just driving by. Observing from the road. No stop, no approach."

"I know."

"I mean it, Gray. We don't have probable cause for a search warrant. We can't even knock on his door without risking complications later."

Brandon looked up from his phone. "Understood."

Matt relaxed slightly. The rain came harder. He flicked on the wipers. The rhythmic sweep was the only sound for a moment.

"So, next steps after this," Matt said. "I think we need to try for surveillance footage from businesses on Route 39 going north out of Blackburn. Gas stations, drug stores, anything with cameras that could've capture the road. If Kovacs drove that route the night Sarah disappeared, maybe someone caught his truck."

"That's six months ago. Most places don't keep footage that long."

"Some do. Worth checking." Matt felt the wheels slip a bit on the wet tar and gravel road. 

"We need to re-interview Travis Walton," Brandon added. "The witness from the Crossroads. His statement was thin."

Matt had read Walton's statement three times. Thirty-one years old, worked construction, had stopped for cigarettes. Saw Sarah's purse by the payphone, called 911. Told deputies he didn't see or hear anything. "You think he's hiding something?"

"I think he saw more than he told them. Maybe not much more, but something. Sometimes you just need to ask the right questions."

The GPS announced their turn. Matt slowed and turned onto County Road 275. The pavement was cracked and patched, weeds growing through the edges. Fields stretched out on both sides—corn stubble from the fall harvest, waiting for winter.

"Half a mile ahead," Brandon said.

Matt eased off the gas, dropping to thirty miles per hour. His pulse kicked up slightly. This was the part of the job that required control—driving past a suspect's property knowing you couldn't stop, couldn't search, couldn't do anything but look.

The first structure that appeared was a mailbox. Faded red with the numbers 6847 in peeling white paint. Matt noted it without slowing further.

"That's it," Brandon said quietly.

The property sat back from the road about a hundred feet. The driveway was gravel, rutted from use. The house itself was a small ranch-style structure, probably built in the sixties or seventies. White siding gone gray with age and weather. Black shutters. A concrete front porch with no furniture, no welcome mat, nothing that suggested anyone cared about the property's appearance.

Behind the house, partially visible through the rain, was the barn. Weathered red wood, the paint mostly gone. The roof sagged slightly in the middle. One of the large doors hung at an angle, the bottom hinge broken or missing.

Matt kept driving at a steady pace, not too slow, not too fast. Just a car passing by on a rural road.

But something felt wrong. He couldn't articulate it—no specific detail he could point to. Just a weight in his chest, a tightness that said *pay attention*. The property had the look of a place where bad things happened and nobody noticed.

Brandon had turned in his seat, looking back.

Matt drove another hundred yards, then pulled onto the shoulder and stopped.

"What are you doing?" Brandon asked.

Matt stared at the rearview mirror. Rain obscured the property now, but he could still picture it. The sagging barn. The lifeless house. The woods pressing in from the north side.

"We should knock and talk," Matt said.

Brandon looked at him. "I thought we weren't stopping."

"We're not searching. We're just following up with someone who was friendly with Sarah. Seeing if Kovacs remembered anything about that day. We know from his borrowing history that he was in the library." Matt put the car in reverse, backing carefully along the shoulder. "It's a legitimate investigative technique."

"Since when are you the one pushing boundaries?"

"Since I got a bad feeling about that barn." Matt turned into Kovacs's driveway. The gravel crunched under the tires. "You're not the only one with instincts."

Brandon said nothing, but Matt caught the slight upturn at the corner of his partner's mouth.

The driveway curved slightly, bringing them closer to the house. Matt parked about thirty feet from the front porch, leaving room to turn around quickly if needed. He killed the engine. The rain drummed on the roof.

"His truck's not here," Brandon observed.

Matt had already noticed. No vehicles visible. No lights on in the house. No movement in the windows. 

"It could be in the garage."

They got out. The rain soaked through Matt's shirt immediately. He pulled his jacket tighter and walked toward the front porch. Brandon followed a step behind. Moving slower, less bothered by the falling rain.

The porch was concrete, cracked in several places. Dead leaves had collected in the corners. A window air conditioning unit sat dark in one window, plastic sheeting taped around it for winter. The front door was white metal with a small window at eye level, covered from the inside with a curtain.

Matt knocked. Three solid raps. "Mr. Kovacs? FBI. We'd like to talk to you."

No answer. No sound from inside.

He knocked again. Waited.

Nothing.

"Not home," Matt said, stating the obvious.

Brandon had moved to the edge of the porch, looking toward the barn. The rain made it hard to see clearly, but the structure loomed dark against the gray sky.

"I'm going to look around," Brandon said.

Matt should have stopped him. Should have said they'd done their due diligence, knocked on the door, no one home, time to leave. But that feeling in his chest hadn't gone away. If anything, it had gotten stronger.

"Stay within plain view," Matt said. "Don't go inside anything."

Brandon stepped off the porch and walked toward the barn.

Matt followed, his shoes squelching in the muddy ground. The rain had turned the yard into soft earth that stuck to his soles. He could feel water running down his collar.

The barn sat about fifty yards behind the house. As they got closer, Matt could see it was in worse shape than it had looked from the road. The wood was rotted in places. Several boards had fallen away, leaving gaps in the walls. The door that hung crooked swayed slightly in the wind.

Brandon stopped about ten feet from the entrance. He stood very still, rain streaming down his face, staring at the barn.

"Gray?" Matt said quietly.

Brandon didn't answer. His expression had gone distant, unfocused. Matt recognized that look—the same one Brandon got at crime scenes, when he was processing something Matt couldn't see.

After a long moment, Brandon walked to the barn entrance. He grabbed the edge of the crooked door and pulled it open wider. It caught on its broken hinge and groaned audibly despite the rain.

"Brandon," Matt said, louder now. "We can't go in without—"

But Brandon had already stepped inside.

Matt swore under his breath and followed.

The interior was dark and smelled of rot and old hay. Rain came through gaps in the roof, creating pools on the dirt floor. Matt's eyes adjusted slowly. He could make out wooden support beams, a hayloft above, farming equipment that looked like it hadn't been used in decades. A rusted plow. Some kind of harvester with a flat tire.

Brandon stood in the center of the space, turning slowly. His breathing had changed—slower, deeper. His hands hung at his sides.

"Brandon," Matt said again. Quieter this time, almost a whisper, because something about the space demanded quiet.

"Something happened here." Brandon's voice barely audible over the rain.

Matt felt the hair on his arms stand up. The barn was just a barn. Old, rotting, abandoned. There was nothing obviously wrong with it.

But he felt it too. That same wrongness he'd felt driving past the property. Concentrated here, in this space.

Brandon walked to the back corner, where shadows were deepest. He crouched down, his hand hovering over the dirt floor without quite touching it.

"What do you see?" Matt asked.

Brandon didn't answer. He stayed crouched for what felt like a full minute, motionless except for his eyes tracking something across the floor. Then he stood and moved to one of the support beams. His fingers traced the wood about four feet up from the ground.

"We need to come back," Brandon said. "With a warrant and a forensics team."

"Based on what?"

Brandon turned to face him. In the dim light, his expression was hard to read. "She was here, Matt. Sarah was here."

"How do you—"

"She was here." Brandon's voice was flat, certain. "And this is where she died."

Matt wanted to ask how Brandon knew. Wanted concrete evidence, something he could put in a report. But Brandon was already walking toward the entrance, moving quickly now, like he needed to get out.

Matt followed him back into the rain. Brandon walked several yards away from the barn and stopped, breathing hard. Not from exertion. From something else.

"You okay?" Matt asked.

Brandon nodded, but didn't speak.

Matt looked back at the barn. Just an old structure on a rural property. Nothing obviously incriminating. Nothing a judge would accept as probable cause.

But Brandon was right. Matt felt it in his gut. Something terrible had happened in that barn.

"Let's go," Matt said. "We need to talk to the sheriff's office. Figure out how to get a legal search going."

They walked back to the car, both soaked through. Matt started the engine and turned the heat on high. Brandon sat in the passenger seat, staring straight ahead, his jaw tight.

Matt backed out of the driveway and headed toward Rockville, the county seat. Twenty-five minutes away. Where they'd meet with Chief Deputy whoever-he-was and try to explain why they needed a warrant to search a barn based on a feeling.

Neither of them spoke during the drive. The rain continued. The wipers beat their rhythm.

Matt kept thinking about the way Brandon had moved through that barn. The certainty in his voice when he said Sarah had died there.

Three years working with Brandon Gray, and Matt still didn't understand how his partner knew the things he knew.

But he'd learned to trust it.

And right now, every instinct Matt had—the normal ones, the ones based on observation and experience and gut feeling—was telling him Brandon was right.

Sarah Carpenter had been in that barn.

And their next step was to prove it.

---

The Parke County Sheriff's Office sat on the west side of Rockville's courthouse square, a two-story brick building that looked like it had been built in the seventies and never updated. Matt pulled into the visitor parking lot at twelve-fifteen. The rain had lessened to a drizzle.

"Let me do most of the talking," Matt said as they got out of the car. "At least at first."

Brandon nodded. He'd been quiet the entire drive, staring out the window at the passing farmland. His shirt was still damp from the barn, and he'd turned the heat vent directly on himself for the last ten minutes of the drive.

Inside, the building smelled like old coffee and floor wax. A reception desk sat behind bulletproof glass. A woman in her fifties with reading glasses and a sheriff's office polo looked up when they entered.

Matt showed his badge. "Special Agents Ellis and Gray, FBI. We're here to see Chief Deputy—" He paused, realizing he didn't have a name.

"Dunham," the woman said. "Tom Dunham. You're the boys looking at the Carpenter case?"

"Yes, ma'am."

She picked up a phone, pressed a button. "Tom, the FBI agents are here." A pause. "Okay." She hung up and pointed to a door on their right. "Through there. Second office on the left."

The hallway was narrow, lined with photos of past sheriffs and deputies. Matt counted eight different sheriffs going back to 1952. At the end of the hall, a break room door stood open. Inside, someone was heating something in a microwave that smelled like freezer burned lasagna.

The second office on the left had a nameplate: Chief Deputy Tom Dunham. The door was open. Matt knocked on the frame anyway.

"Come in."

The office was small and tidy. A metal desk with a computer monitor, stacks of files arranged chronologically, and a bookshelf holding law enforcement manuals and what looked like case binders. The walls held certificates and commendations, most from the Joliet Police Department in Illinois.

Chief Deputy Tom Dunham stood and came around the desk. Late forties, maybe fifty. Average height and slightly overweight like an ex-athlete gone to seed. Thinning brown hair cut short. He wore khakis and a button-down shirt with a tie loosened at the collar. His handshake was firm but perfunctory.

"Tom Dunham," he said. "Sheriff Garrett said you'd be stopping by."

"Matt Ellis." Matt gestured to Brandon. "This is my partner, Brandon Gray."

Dunham shook Brandon's hand, then gestured to two chairs across from his desk. "Have a seat. Coffee?"

"We're good, thanks," Matt said.

They sat. Dunham returned to his chair and leaned back slightly, his expression neutral but guarded. Not hostile, exactly. Just the look of someone who'd seen federal agents come and go before and wasn't particularly optimistic about the outcome.

"Sheriff said the Bureau's taking a fresh look at Sarah Carpenter," Dunham said. "Six months old. That's a long time for a missing person case."

"Sometimes fresh eyes help," Matt said. "We appreciate you reaching out to us."

"That was the sheriff's call. I just work here." Dunham's tone was flat, matter-of-fact. "But yeah, I was the one who worked the case when she first disappeared. Me and Deputy Kowalski—you met him yesterday at the Crossroads."

"We did. He was helpful."

"He's a good kid. Still green, but he follows procedure." Dunham pulled a file from one of the stacks on his desk. Thick manila folder, Sarah Carpenter's name written on the tab. "I've got everything we compiled. Witness statements, security footage, the truck canvas, phone records. You probably already have copies, but if you need originals, they're here."

Matt leaned forward slightly. "We've reviewed the files. I wanted to ask about the truck canvas. Twenty-seven Chevy Silverados, black or a dark shade of blue or green, late nineties models. You talked to all the owners?"

"Every single one. Most of them personally, a few by phone if they were out of state." Dunham opened the file, flipped through pages. "Checked alibis, looked at the vehicles when we could. Nothing stood out. A couple guys were squirrelly about letting us look in their truck beds, but that turned out to be because one had an open container violation and the other was behind on registration."

"What about people who had access to those trucks but weren't the registered owners?" Brandon asked. It was the first time he'd spoken since they'd arrived.

Dunham looked at him. "Like who?"

"Family members. Employees. Friends who borrowed vehicles."

"We asked. Nobody had anything that seemed relevant." Dunham closed the file. "Look, I know what you're thinking. Small county sheriff's office, limited resources, maybe we missed something. And maybe we did. But we worked this case hard for three months. Every lead, every tip, every person who even looked at Sarah sideways. It all went nowhere."

Matt kept his tone even. "We're not here to second-guess your work, Chief Deputy. We're just trying to find new angles."

"Call me Tom." Dunham's expression softened slightly, though the guardedness remained. "And I get it. Really. This case—" He paused, looking at the file on his desk. "Sarah Carpenter was a good kid. Worked at the library, helped her mom pay bills, planning to go to college. She didn't deserve what happened to her. Her mother doesn't deserve to not know."

"You've stayed in touch with Mrs. Carpenter?" Brandon asked.

"Someone from the office checks in about once a month. Usually me. Let her know we haven't forgotten." Dunham's jaw tightened. "But six months with no leads, no body, no activity on her cards—it's hard to tell a mother we're still working it when we don't have anything to work."

Matt glanced at Brandon, then back to Dunham. "We may have a lead. A person of interest we'd like to look into further."

Dunham sat up straighter. "Who?"

"Dale Kovacs. Forty-six, lives on County Road 275. He was a regular at the library where Sarah worked. Made her uncomfortable. Drives a dark blue Silverado, late nineties model. And he was at the library the day she disappeared."

Dunham's expression didn't change, but Matt saw the recognition in his eyes. "Kovacs was on our list. We talked to him back in late April. He said he was at the library that afternoon, left around seven, went home. Lived alone, no alibi, but no direct evidence linking him to the abduction. Just happened to drive the same truck."

"Did you search his property?" Brandon asked.

"Didn't have cause. He was cooperative, answered questions, let us look in his truck. Nothing suspicious. No blood, no signs of a struggle, no personal items that didn't belong to him."

"What about his barn?" Brandon's voice was quiet, controlled.

Dunham frowned. "What about it?"

"Did you search it?"

"Drove by the property, saw the barn from the road. But there are a lot of old barns out here. Like I said, we didn't have probable cause for a search warrant. Kovacs being creepy and driving the right truck isn't enough for a judge."

Matt chose his words carefully. "We drove by his property this morning. We got a bad feeling about that barn."

Dunham looked at Matt, then at Brandon. "A bad feeling."

"Yes."

"You want me to apply for a warrant based on a bad feeling?"

"We want to find Sarah Carpenter," Brandon said. His tone was level, but there was an edge underneath. "And I think she was in that barn."

Dunham leaned back in his chair. "You *think*. Based on what evidence?"

"Kovacs fits the profile," Matt said. "He knew Sarah, made her uncomfortable, drives the right vehicle, was present the day of the abduction. His recent library checkouts include books on wilderness survival, topographical maps, and forensic investigation techniques—"

"That's still circumstantial," Dunham interrupted. "I'm not saying it's not worth looking at. I'm saying no judge in this county is going to sign a warrant based on circumstantial evidence and a gut feeling."

"Even if that gut feeling is right?" Brandon asked.

"Even then. Because if we search without proper cause and find something, a defense attorney will get it thrown out. And if we search and don't find anything, we've violated his Fourth Amendment rights and opened the county up to a lawsuit." Dunham's voice was firm but not unkind. "I've been doing this job for twenty-six years. Twenty of those in Joliet, Illinois, where we actually had resources and case law on our side. I know how to work a case. And I know the difference between wanting to solve something and having the legal grounds to act on it."

Matt felt the frustration building but kept it off his face. "So what do you suggest?"

"Keep building the case. Interview more people. Cross-reference Kovacs's movements with Sarah's routine. Find a witness who saw his truck near the Crossroads that night. Get phone records, financial records, anything that puts him at the scene or establishes a pattern of stalking behavior." Dunham tapped the desk. "Get me something concrete, and I'll take it to Judge Morrison myself. But I'm not asking for a warrant based on vibes."

Brandon stood abruptly. "Excuse me." He walked out of the office.

Matt stayed seated, watching Dunham's reaction.

"Your partner always like that?" Dunham asked.

"Sometimes. This case is getting to him."

"It got to me too. Still does." Dunham's expression softened again. "Look, Agent Ellis—Matt—I want to help. I really do. If Kovacs is our guy, I want him in a cell. But I also want the conviction to stick. And that means doing everything by the book."

"I understand." Matt stood. "Can we get access to the original case files, including your personal notes? Sometimes there are observations that don't make it into the official reports."

"Sure. I'll have them ready for you tomorrow morning. Where are you staying?"

"Quality Inn off Route 39."

"I'll call when they're ready." Dunham walked Matt to the door. "For what it's worth, I hope your gut is right. I hope Sarah's in that barn and we can bring her home. But we have to do this right."

"Agreed."

Matt found Brandon outside, standing by the car in the drizzle. He wasn't getting in, just standing there with his hands in his pockets, staring at nothing.

"You okay?" Matt asked.

"He's not wrong." Brandon's voice was flat. "We need more than what we have."

"So we get it. We re-interview Walton. We track down surveillance footage. We build the case until it's airtight."

Brandon turned to look at him. "And if Kovacs destroys evidence while we're building the case?"

"If he was going to do that, he would have done it already. It's been six months."

"Or maybe he's been waiting to see if anyone would come looking. And now we have." Brandon's jaw was tight. "We were at his property this morning. If he has cameras, he knows. If a neighbor saw us, word will get back to him. In small towns, everyone talks."

Matt hadn't thought of that. "Then we move fast. But we move legally."

Brandon didn't respond. He got in the passenger seat and closed the door.

Matt stood in the drizzle for a moment longer, thinking about the barn. About Brandon's certainty. About Dunham's very reasonable insistence on proper procedure.

About the fact that they were probably right—both of them.

He got in the car and started the engine.

"Where to?" Brandon asked.

Matt checked his watch. Eleven-forty. "Let's get lunch. Then we track down Travis Walton and see what he remembers that he didn't tell the deputies the first time."

They drove back toward Thorndale in silence. The rain had stopped, leaving everything wet and gray. Matt's mind was already working through the next steps. Witness interviews. Records requests. Building the legal framework that would let them do what they both knew needed to be done.

Search that barn.

Find Sarah Carpenter.

And prove that Brandon's instincts—whatever they were, however they worked—had been right all along.
