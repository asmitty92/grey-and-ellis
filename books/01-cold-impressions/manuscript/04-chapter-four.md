# Chapter Four
**Thursday Afternoon**

Brandon finished the last bite of his gas station sandwich as Matt pulled into the construction site. Turkey and swiss on wheat bread, it provided sustenance and not much else. He'd barely noticed eating it. His mind was still in that barn, replaying the impressions that had settled over him like a weight.

The construction site sat on the north edge of Thorndale where Main Street became farmland. A sign near the entrance read "Hoosier Heritage Homes - Custom Building Since 1987." Beyond it, a concrete foundation had been poured for what would eventually be someone's house. Probably their dream house, given the size of the footprint. But today, with the rain still misting down and the sky the color of wet concrete, the site looked abandoned.

A white pickup truck was parked near a job trailer—the kind contractors used as mobile offices. The truck had "Walton Construction" painted on the door in fading letters. Matt had called ahead. Travis Walton was expecting them.

"You want me to take the lead on this one?" Matt asked as he put the car in park.

Brandon crumpled the sandwich wrapper. "I've got it."

They got out. The rain had lessened to a fine mist that hung in the air rather than falling. Brandon's shirt was still damp from the barn, and the cold settled into his bones as they walked toward the trailer.

The door opened before they reached it. A man in his early thirties stepped out, wearing work boots, jeans, and a Carhartt jacket over a flannel shirt. Dark hair, stubble that suggested he'd been too busy to shave that morning. He looked tired. Not just today-tired, but the kind of tired that came from carrying something heavy for a long time.

"Travis Walton?" Matt asked, showing his badge.

"Yeah." Walton shook both their hands. His grip was firm, calloused. "FBI, right? You boys move fast, you only called me an hour ago."

"We appreciate you making time," Matt said.

"Not like we're getting anything done today." Walton gestured at the gray sky. "Can't pour concrete in this weather. Can't frame either—lumber's too wet. Crew's at lunch. Figured I'd catch up on paperwork, but honestly I was just staring at invoices."

"This won't take long," Brandon said. "We just have some follow-up questions about the night Sarah Carpenter disappeared."

Walton's expression shifted—something between resignation and discomfort. "I already told the deputies everything I saw. Which wasn't much."

"I understand. Sometimes talking through it again helps clarify details." Brandon kept his voice even, neutral. Not pushy. Just patient. "Can we sit inside?"

Walton nodded and led them into the trailer. The interior was exactly what Brandon expected—cluttered but well organized. A desk covered with blueprints and invoices, a filing cabinet, a small coffee maker on a card table, folding chairs. The space heater in the corner worked overtime, making the air stuffy and warm. It smelled like diesel fuel and wood shavings.

Walton gestured to two folding chairs and took the desk chair for himself. He pulled a pack of cigarettes from his jacket pocket, then seemed to think better of it and set them on the desk.

"You still smoke?" Brandon asked.

"Trying to quit. Been saying that for three years." Walton picked up a pen, turned it over in his fingers. Nervous energy. "That's why I was at the Crossroads that night. Ran out of cigarettes, wanted to pick up a pack that night so I could get an early start the next morning."

Brandon pulled out his notebook and a pen. "Walk me through that night. What time did you get off work?"

"Round five to five-fifteen. We'd been working a job in Brazil—that's about forty minutes southwest of here. Framing a pole barn. We wrapped up, I drove back toward Thorndale."

"Did you come straight home?"

"No. Stopped at the Rural King in Blackburn first. Needed some supplies for the next day."

Brandon made notes, letting Walton establish his own timeline. "What time were you at the Rural King?"

"It's between Brazil and Thorndale, so I probably got there around five-forty. I didn't dilly-dally—grabbed what I needed, talked to Jim for a few, then paid and left."

"Jim?"

"Jim Haskell, he's the general manager there. We talked about the last Colts game for a few minutes. That's it."

Brandon nodded, writing. "Then what?"

"Drove home. Got there around six-fifteen or twenty after. Ate some leftover pizza and watched TV. I smoked my last cigarette around eight. I wanted to get to the job site in Brazil early next day, so I didn't want to stop in the morning. The gas station in Thorndale closes at seven, so I drove down to the Crossroads. It's open till eleven."

"What route did you take to the Crossroads?"

"Main Street to Route 39, then south. Same way everybody goes."

"Did you see any other vehicles on the way?"

Walton frowned, thinking. "A few. Not many—it was a Thursday night, most people were home. There was a sedan going north as I headed south. Maybe a Honda or Toyota, something like that. And a farm truck pulled out of a driveway ahead of me, but he turned off onto County Road 400."

"What about when you got to the Crossroads?"

"Sarah's car was in the lot when I pulled in. I recognized it—she drove that little red Honda Civic, had a library bumper sticker on the back. I didn't think much of it at the time. People stop there for gas all the time."

"Where did you park?"

"By the front door. The pumps were empty, so I had my choice of spots." Walton set down the pen and picked up the cigarette pack, turning it over in his hands without opening it. "I went inside. Marv was in the cooler, but he came up front when he heard me come in. I grabbed three packs of Marlboros, paid, and left. Maybe two minutes total."

"Did you notice Sarah while you were inside?"

"No. The payphone's around the side of the building. You can't see it from inside unless you're at the window, and I wasn't paying attention to windows. I was tired. Just wanted to get my cigarettes and go home."

Brandon leaned forward slightly. "When you came out, what did you see?"

"Her purse was on the ground by the payphone. The phone was off the hook, hanging down. Her car was still there, but she wasn't." Walton's jaw tightened. "I called 911 right away. Stayed on the line until Deputy Kowalski showed up."

Brandon made a note. An abduction interrupted mid-call. He'd heard about one like that before. The person on the other end of the line never stopped hearing it.

"Did you hear anything while you were inside? A scream, a car door, an engine?"

"No. Marv had the radio on. And I wasn't listening for anything. Why would I be?"

Brandon nodded, making another note. "Let me back up. When you pulled into the lot, was there any other vehicle there besides Sarah's car?"

Walton started to shake his head, then stopped. "Wait. Yeah. There was a truck parked on the far side of the building. Away from the pumps. I didn't think about it until now."

Brandon's pulse quickened, but he kept his expression neutral. "What kind of truck?"

"Chevy. Older model. Dark color-coulda been black, but I'm almost positive it was blue. There's no lights on that side of the building, but some of the lights over the pumps caught it." Walton's eyes went distant, like he was replaying the memory. "I only noticed it because it seemed like a weird place to park. The pumps were empty, the lot was empty. Why park way over there unless you didn't want to be visible from the road?"

"Did you see anyone in or near the truck?"

"No. But I wasn't looking. I assumed whoever owned it was inside the store."

Matt had his notebook out now, writing quickly. Brandon maintained eye contact with Walton. "When you came back out after buying cigarettes, was the truck still there?"

Walton closed his eyes, concentrating. "No. It was gone. I remember that now. When I saw Sarah's purse and went to call 911, I looked around to see if anyone else was there who could help. The lot was empty except for her car and mine."

"So the truck left while you were inside."

"Must have. Like I said, I was only in there two minutes. Maybe less."

Brandon made another note, his mind already working through the timeline. Sarah on the phone. Travis inside buying cigarettes. The truck pulling out with Sarah inside it. All in the space of ninety seconds, maybe two minutes.

"Did you notice anything else about the truck? Damage, bumper stickers, anything in the bed?"

Walton was quiet for a moment. Brandon watched his face—the way his eyes moved, the slight tension in his jaw. He was trying to remember, not fabricate. That was important. Witnesses who were making things up looked different. They looked up and to the left, accessing the creative parts of their brain. Walton was looking straight ahead, accessing memory.

"There was something on the back window," Walton said slowly. "One of those decals. I couldn't tell you what it was, but there was something there. Caught the light wrong, made it stand out."

"What kind of decal? Sports team? Business logo?"

"I don't know. I barely registered it. Just... something white or light-colored against the dark glass."

Brandon filed that away. "And you didn't see which direction it went when it left?"

"No. Like I said, I was inside."

"Is there anything else you remember about that night? Anything that seemed off or unusual?"

Walton shook his head slowly. "Just... I keep thinking if I'd come out of the store thirty seconds earlier at the Crossroads, maybe I could have stopped it. Maybe Sarah would still be—" His voice caught.

"This isn't your fault," Matt said. "You couldn't have known."

"Yeah, well, doesn't make it easier to sleep." Walton picked up the cigarettes again, this time pulling one out and sticking it between his lips unlit. "Is there anything else? I've got to call the crew, let them know we're done for the day."

Brandon closed his notebook. "Thank you, Mr. Walton. I appreciate you taking the time. This has been helpful."

"I have?" Walton looked genuinely surprised. "I didn't think I knew anything useful."

"Sometimes the details that don't seem important are the ones that matter." Brandon stood, and Matt followed his lead. "If you remember anything else, here's my card."

Walton took the card, studied it. "You really think you're going to find her?"

Brandon chose his words carefully. "We're going to find out what happened to her."

It wasn't quite the same thing, but it was honest.

As Brandon got up to leave, Travis spoke up again slowly.

"You know, that wasn't the only time I saw a dark colored Chevy that day. There was one at the Rural King blocking my way when I went to leave. A Silverado, dark blue. Guy was loading boxes into the back."

"Can you describe the man?"

"Average height, average build. He had a baseball cap on, kept his head down. I had to wait for him to move so I could get my truck out—he was blocking the drive." Walton looked between Brandon and Matt. "I'm not sure it was the same truck from the Crossroads, but it coulda been."

"I mighta seen the guy two hours before he took Sarah," Travis said wistfully.

"Did you get a look at his face?"

"Not really. Like I said, he had his head down. I was more focused on getting around him than looking at him." Walton ran a hand through his hair. "I should have paid more attention. Should have—"

"You had no way of knowing," Matt said quietly. "Can you remember what he was loading?"

"Boxes. Three or four of them, I think. Not huge, but he was handling them carefully. Like they were breakable or expensive."

"Were they marked? Any logos or writing you could see?"

Walton closed his eyes again, concentrating. "I don't... maybe? There might have been something printed on them, but I was too far away to read it."

"What time was this?"

"Right before I left. So around six, maybe a few minutes before."

Brandon exchanged a glance with Matt. A dark blue Silverado at the Rural King around six. At the Crossroads by eight. Two hours between.

They left Walton in his trailer and walked back to the car. The rain had stopped completely now, leaving the air cold and damp. Brandon's shoes squelched in the mud.

"Rural King at six," Matt said once they were in the car. "That gives us a place to check for surveillance footage."

"And it puts someone in a dark blue Silverado in Blackburn two hours before the abduction." Brandon pulled out his phone and opened the map. "The library's in Blackburn. So is the Rural King. If he tampered with Sarah's car while she was working, he would have had time to do it between six and seven-thirty, then drive down to the Crossroads and wait."

"What do you think he was loading at the Rural King?"

Brandon stared out at the construction site, his mind working through possibilities. "Hunting equipment, maybe. Could be trail cameras—would fit with the books Kovacs has been checking out. Wilderness survival, topographical maps. Someone planning surveillance would need equipment like that."

"That's a pretty specific conclusion from 'boxes.'"

"It's a hypothesis," Brandon said. "But it's testable. We go to the Rural King, check their transaction records, see what he bought."

Matt started the engine. "It's one-thirty. If they close at six, we've got time. But Brandon—even if we confirm someone bought trail cameras, that's still not probable cause for a warrant. We don't even know for sure it was Kovacs."

"I know. But it's another piece. And pieces add up." Brandon turned to look at his partner. "If we can identify the buyer, if we can connect him to Kovacs, if we can find out where those cameras were placed—"

"That's a lot of ifs."

"That's what investigation is."

Matt pulled out of the construction site and headed toward Blackburn. The drive would take about fifteen minutes. Brandon watched the fields go by, thinking about timelines and opportunities.

"You think Kovacs is working alone?" Matt asked.

"I think—" Brandon paused, choosing his words. "I think there's something about this case that doesn't add up. If Kovacs did this, why make himself so visible? Why keep checking out books that make him look guilty? Why return to the library after the case is reopened?"

"Because he's arrogant. Because he thinks he's smarter than us."

"Maybe." Brandon wasn't convinced. "Or because he's trying to solve it too."

Matt was quiet for a moment. "You think he knows who took Sarah but isn't saying?"

"I think he knows something. And whatever it is, it's eating at him." Brandon thought about the unsigned notes at the library memorial. *I'm so sorry. I think about you every day. I'm sorry I couldn't help you.* "Guilt is a powerful motivator. Makes people do strange things."

They drove into Blackburn, passing through downtown—a main street lined with older buildings, a few shops, a diner, the library with its Carnegie architecture and copper dome. The Rural King sat on the east edge of town, a sprawling building that sold everything from livestock feed to hardware to hunting gear and outdoor clothing.

They pulled into the parking lot. A few trucks scattered around, mostly older models with rust and dents. Working vehicles, not show pieces. Brandon scanned them automatically, looking for dark blue or black Silverados. Not expecting to find any.

Inside, the store smelled like feed and fertilizer and gun oil. A mix of rural Indiana commerce. The front area held registers and an office. To the left, hardware and building supplies. To the right, hunting and fishing gear. Straight back, livestock feed and farming equipment.

A man in his sixties stood behind the counter, wearing overalls and a John Deere cap. He looked up when they entered, his expression friendly but curious. Probably didn't get FBI agents in here often.

Matt took the lead this time. "Afternoon. We're Special Agents Ellis and Gray with the FBI. We'd like to talk to the manager about a purchase from April of this year."

The man's eyebrows went up. "Last April? That's a long time ago."

"We understand. But we're hoping your system keeps transaction records long."

"Let me get Jim. He's the general manager." The man disappeared into the back office and returned a moment later with a younger man—early forties, weathered face, the look of someone who'd worked retail long enough to be skeptical of everyone.

"Jim Haskell," he said, shaking their hands. "Hugh said you're hear about a transaction six months ago. Is this about Sarah Carpenter?"

"Yes sir," Matt said. "We understand you knew her?"

"I grew up in Thorndale with her mom. She used to come in here for gardening supplies. My kids knew Sarah, through the library. She ran most of the children's programs there. She was good with kids." Haskell's expression turned sad. "Terrible thing. You guys have a lead?"

"We're following up on several possibilities. One of them involves a customer who may have been here on April sixteenth, between five and six PM. We were hoping you could check your transaction history for the purchase."

Haskell thought for a moment. "I can probably find the transaction. You know, corporate upgraded the surveillance system to digital late last year. All footage is stored to a hard drive now. Nothing gets overwritten. Might have to delete at some point if the hard drive gets full, but that hasn't happened yet."

Matt and Brandon exchanged a meaningful look. Matt spoke first.

"Being able to see that footage would be a huge help."

"I understand." Jim said slowly. "But I think I'll have to check with corporate legal first. They're probably going to insist on a warrant or subpeona before they'll let me hand it over."

Brandon had expected this. "We can get that. But would you be willing to look at the footage with us here? We're trying to confirm whether a specific person was here that day."

Haskell considered this. Technically, looking at his own footage with law enforcement present wasn't handing it over. He could still say no, but Brandon could see him working through it.

"Who are you looking for?" Haskell asked.

"Dale Kovacs. Drives a Chevy Silverado, mid-forties, brown hair."

Haskell's expression shifted. Recognition, but not surprise. "Yeah, I know Dale. He comes in here maybe once a month. Usually for hunting gear or tools."

"Was he here on April sixteenth?"

"I couldn't tell you without checking." Haskell glanced at the office, then back to them. "All right. Come on back. But I'm not giving you copies without a warrant. We can just look."

"That's all we're asking," Matt said.

They followed Haskell into the back office. The space was cramped—desk, filing cabinets, a computer setup that looked like it had been cobbled together from parts over several years. Haskell sat at the computer and pulled up the surveillance software.

"April sixteenth, 2010?" Haskell confirmed, typing.

"Yes sir," Brandon said. "Between five and six-thirty PM if possible."

The screen showed a grid of six camera angles. Front entrance, parking lot, lumber yard, hunting section, registers, and loading dock. Haskell clicked on the parking lot view and started scrubbing through the footage at 4x speed.

Brandon watched the screen. Cars coming and going, customers in and out. The afternoon sun casting long shadows across the lot. He checked the timestamp. 5:32 PM. Then 5:41 PM. Then 5:49 PM.

"There," Matt said, pointing.

A dark blue Silverado pulled into the lot and parked near the lumber yard entrance. The driver got out—average height, average build, baseball cap pulled low. He walked toward the store entrance. Thirty seconds later, he entered the store pushing a shopping cart.

Haskell switched camera views to the hunting section. The man walked directly to the trail camera display, selected four boxes, and put them in the cart. Then he moved to the register.

"Can you get a clear shot of his face?" Brandon asked.

Haskell switched to the register camera. The man kept his head down while he paid, but when he pulled out his wallet, the angle caught his face for just a second.

Dale Kovacs.

"That's him," Brandon said quietly.

Haskell switched back to the parking lot view. Kovacs loaded the four boxes into the bed of his truck, climbed in, and drove away. Timestamp: 5:58 PM.

Four trail cameras. Purchased just over two hours before Sarah Carpenter was abducted.

Brandon felt that familiar sensation—pieces clicking together. Not complete yet. Not enough for a warrant. But getting closer.

"Can you tell what specific model he bought?" Matt asked.

Haskell squinted at the screen. "Looks like the Bushnell Trophy Cam. Good cameras. Motion-activated, infrared night vision, takes both photos and video. Hunters love them. We sold a lot of them that spring."

"Do you keep records of what customers buy?"

"If they pay with a card, yeah. Cash purchases we don't track by name unless they use a loyalty card."

"Could you check if Kovacs paid with a card?"

Haskell pulled up a different program and typed for a moment. "Yeah. Credit card purchase. April sixteenth, 5:55 PM. Four Bushnell Trophy Cam HD cameras and two eight-packs of AA batteries. Total came to two hundred thirty-six dollars and forty-seven cents."

Brandon looked at Matt. "That's specific. He knew exactly what he wanted."

"And he bought batteries," Matt added. "He was planning to set them up right away."

Haskell looked between them. "You think Dale did something to Sarah?"

"We're investigating all possibilities," Brandon said carefully. "Would you be willing to provide us with a copy of that transaction record?"

"I can print you a receipt. That's public information—what someone bought. The video footage you'll need a warrant for."

"The receipt is enough for now," Matt said. "We appreciate your cooperation."

Haskell printed the receipt and handed it to Matt. "Dale's always been a little strange, but I never figured him for... you know. He always seemed harmless. Quiet."

"They usually do," Brandon said.

They left the Rural King with the receipt and a timestamp that put Kovacs buying surveillance equipment two hours before Sarah disappeared. Combined with his truck matching the description from the Crossroads, his uncomfortable relationship with Sarah, his suspicious reading materials, and the feeling Brandon couldn't shake about that barn—it was adding up.

But it still wasn't enough.

"Where to now?" Matt asked as they got back in the car.

Brandon checked his watch. Two-thirty. "Back to the motel. We need to compile everything we have and figure out our next move. Dunham said he'd have the original case files ready tomorrow. Maybe there's something in his notes we can use."

"And then?"

"And then we figure out where Kovacs placed those cameras. Because that's where the answer is."

They drove back toward Thorndale in silence. The rain had started again, light but persistent. Brandon watched the fields go by, thinking about trail cameras and barns and guilt.

About the difference between knowing something and proving it.

About Sarah Carpenter, who just wanted to go to college and study English and become a librarian. Who called her mom to say she'd be late. Who recognized someone she shouldn't have trusted.

Somewhere in Parke County, four trail cameras were watching something. Recording movement. Gathering evidence.

Brandon just had to figure out where.

And what they'd been watching during the past six months.
