# Chapter Five
**Friday Morning**

Matt pulled onto County Road 275 just after nine AM, gravel crunching under the tires. Brandon sat in the passenger seat, quiet since they'd left the motel. He'd been like that all morning—present but distant, like his mind was already at the property they were about to visit.

Dale Kovacs's place sat a half-mile down the road, a white farmhouse with dark green shutters set back from the county road. The house looked well-maintained in that utilitarian way bachelor farmers kept things—paint wasn't peeling, gutters were clean, lawn was mowed. But there were hints of better days: flower boxes under the windows gone to weeds, a faded welcome mat, the remnants of what might have once been a garden bed along the porch. The kind of touches a woman might add that a man living alone would let slip.

Brandon's gaze went straight to the barn when they pulled in.

"You good?" Matt asked.

"Yes." Brandon's voice was flat. "Let's do this."

A dark blue Silverado sat in the driveway, ten to fifteen years old, well-used but clean. Matt parked behind it and they got out. The morning was cool and still, the sky overcast but not threatening rain. A crow called from somewhere in the trees behind the barn.

Matt walked to the truck and glanced at the back window. There—a small decal in the lower corner. He couldn't make out what it was from this angle, but it was there. Same spot Travis had mentioned.

The front door opened before they reached the porch. Dale Kovacs stepped out, wearing jeans and a flannel shirt, work boots, reading glasses pushed up on his forehead. Mid-forties, brown hair going gray at the temples, medium build. He looked tired but not hostile.

"Can I help you?" His tone was neutral, cautious but not unfriendly.

Matt showed his badge. "Agent Ellis, FBI. This is Agent Gray. We're investigating the disappearance of Sarah Carpenter. We'd like to ask you a few questions if you have a few minutes."

Dale's expression didn't change much—a slight tightening around the eyes, but he nodded. "Sure. I saw you boys at the library yesterday didn't I. I already talked to the deputies back in April, but I'm happy to help however I can." He came down off the porch. "You want to come inside, or...?"

"Out here is fine," Matt said. "We won't take much of your time. We're just gathering information from people who knew Sarah and had contact with her around the time she disappeared."

"All right." Dale folded his arms, not defensively but like he was cold. The sun was out today, but the morning was chilly and crisp. "What do you need to know?"

Matt pulled out his notebook. "We understand you are a regular patron at the Blackburn Public Library?"

"That's right. I like to read. Go there a few times a month."

"Did you know Sarah Carpenter?"

"Not really. I mean, I knew who she was. She worked the circulation desk. We'd talk a little when I checked out books. Small talk, nothing personal."

Brandon had moved slightly to the side, his eyes drifting past Dale toward the barn. Matt noticed Dale notice.

"What kind of books do you read, Mr. Kovacs?" Matt asked.

"History, mostly. True crime sometimes. Military history."

"You were at the library on April sixteenth?"

Dale hesitated, just a beat. "I might've been. I don't remember specific dates."

"We have borrowing records that show you checked out three books that afternoon. Around four-thirty."

Dale's jaw tightened slightly. "Okay. Then I was there."

"Did you see Sarah that day?"

"Probably. Like I said, she usually worked the desk."

"Did you talk to her?"

"Just whatever you say when someone checks out your books. 'Have a good day,' that kind of thing."

Brandon spoke for the first time, his voice quiet. "What did you do before you arrived the library?"

Dale looked at him. "Went to the Rural King. Needed some supplies."

"What kind of supplies?" Brandon asked.

"Trail cameras. I'd been having some trouble on my property. I wanted to see what was moving through."

Matt made a note. "What kind of trouble were you having?"

"Something was coming on my property, I'd seen...tracks. I wanted to find out what."

"How many cameras did you buy?"

"Four."

"Where did you place them?" Brandon asked. His gaze kept drifting toward the barn.

"Couple in front near the road, couple out back."

"Near the barn?" Brandon's eyes finally settled on Dale.

Dale's expression shifted—something flickered there. Wariness. "One of them was, yeah."

Matt kept his tone conversational. "What time did you leave the Rural King?"

"I don't know. Maybe six, six-fifteen."

"And what about after the library? What did you do then?"

"Came home. Set up the cameras. Had dinner."

"Did you go out again that evening?"

"No."

"You didn't stop anywhere after the library?"

Dale's arms tightened slightly. "No. I came straight here."

Matt flipped through his notes, letting the silence stretch. Brandon had turned fully toward the barn now, staring at it like he was reading something written on its walls.

"Mr. Kovacs," Matt said, "we have a witness who saw a Silverado at the Crossroads Mini-Mart the night Sarah disappeared. Around eight-fifteen PM."

Dale's face went carefully blank. "Lot of Silverados around here."

"A dark blue Silverado," Matt clarified. "With a decal on the back window."

Dale said nothing.

"Your truck is dark blue," Matt continued. "And it has a decal on the back window."

"Like I said. Lot of trucks like that."

Brandon turned back to face them. "Were you at the Crossroads that night?"

The question hung in the air. Dale looked between them—Matt's neutral expression, Brandon's intense focus.

"No," Dale said finally.

"Where were you at eight-fifteen?"

"Here. Like I told you."

"Can anyone verify that?"

"I live alone."

Matt made another note. "Mr. Kovacs, Sarah's borrowing records show you checked out books on the same days she was working at least thirteen times in the six months before she disappeared. That seems like more than coincidence."

"It's a small library. She worked most of the shifts."

"But you'd come in more frequently in those months than you had previously."

Dale's jaw worked. "I don't keep track of how often I go to the library."

"Did you have any kind of relationship with Sarah outside the library?"

"No."

"Did you ever ask her out? Try to spend time with her?"

"No."

Brandon spoke again, his voice very quiet. "But you wanted to."

Dale's eyes snapped to Brandon. "What?"

"You noticed her. You came in more often because you wanted to see her."

"I went to check out books."

"Thirteen times in six months," Brandon said. "Always when she was working. You knew her schedule."

Dale's hands flexed. "I didn't do anything wrong. Going to a library isn't a crime."

"No," Matt said. "But taking someone against their will is."

"I didn't take anyone anywhere."

"Then why does your truck match the witness description? Why were you buying surveillance equipment two hours before Sarah disappeared? Why—"

"I wasn't at the Crossroads." Dale's voice had risen slightly. Not shouting, but strained. "I was here. All night."

Brandon was staring at the barn again. Matt noticed Dale's eyes following his gaze, and something in his face changed. Fear, maybe. Or guilt.

"That barn trouble you, Mr. Kovacs?" Matt asked.

"What? No. It's just a barn."

"When's the last time you were in it?"

"I don't know. Few weeks ago maybe."

"Not more recently?"

Dale's breathing had quickened slightly. "What do you want from me?"

Matt kept his voice level. "We want to know what happened to Sarah Carpenter."

"I don't know what happened to her."

"I think you do" Brandon said. It wasn't a question.

Dale looked at Brandon for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was tight. "I think you should leave."

"Mr. Kovacs—"

"Do you have a warrant?"

"No," Matt said.

"Then I don't have to talk to you. And I want you off my property." Dale stepped back toward his porch. "If you want to come back, bring a warrant."

Matt held up a hand. "We're not trying to railroad you, Mr. Kovacs. We're just trying to find out what happened to a young woman who disappeared six months ago. If you know anything that could help—"

"She had trouble with her car. Said it wasn't starting right," Dale said suddenly. The words came out rushed, like they'd been pulled from him against his will. "The starter was bad. That's probably why she was at the Crossroads."

Matt went very still. "How do you know that?"

Dale's face had gone pale. "I-I think she mentioned it that day. That's usually why a car won't start, right?"

"The starter specifically," Brandon said. "You said the starter."

"I meant—I just meant—" Dale shook his head. "You need to leave. Now."

"Mr. Kovacs, if you know something about what happened to Sarah's car—"

"Get off my property." Dale's voice was shaking now. "I'm done talking."

Matt exchanged a glance with Brandon. They could push, but without a warrant they had no leverage. And Dale was clearly done cooperating.

"We'll be in touch," Matt said. He pulled a business card from his pocket and held it out. "If you think of anything else you want to tell us."

Dale didn't take the card. Matt set it on the porch railing.

They walked back to the car in silence. Matt glanced at the Silverado as they passed—the decal on the back window was a Browning logo, the deer head silhouette. Same kind of hunting decal you'd see on half the trucks in rural Indiana.

But Travis had seen one. On a dark blue Silverado. At the Crossroads.

Matt started the engine and pulled out of the driveway. In the rearview mirror, he could see Dale standing on his porch, watching them leave. His hands were shaking.

Neither of them spoke until they were back on Route 39, heading toward Thorndale.

"That detail about the starter," Matt said finally.

"Yeah." Brandon was staring out the window.

"No one ever even figured out her card had been tampered with."

"No."

"So either he tampered with her car himself, or—"

"Or he knows who did." Brandon turned to look at Matt. "He's scared. Not just of us. Of something else."

"You think he's protecting someone?"

"Maybe. Or he's afraid of being blamed for something he didn't do."

Matt thought about Dale's face when Brandon had stared at the barn. The fear there. The guilt.

"What did you pick up from him?" Matt asked.

Brandon was quiet for a moment. "He's not a predator. His interest in Sarah—it was real, but not aggressive. Not obsessive in the way you'd expect from someone who'd abduct her. He's got shame, yeah, but it's not the shame of someone who hurt her."

"Then what is it?"

"Failure, maybe. Like he tried to do something and it went wrong."

Matt processed this. "You think he took her? Not to hurt her, but—"

"I don't know what I think yet." Brandon rubbed his face. "But something happened in that barn. Something bad. And he knows about it."

They pulled into the sheriff's department parking lot fifteen minutes later. Dunham's cruiser was there, along with Kowalski's. Matt cut the engine.

"The starter detail is solid if we can confirm it," he said. "Combined with the truck description, the decal, the timeline—that's enough for a warrant."

"Yeah."

"But?"

Brandon looked at him. "But I don't think we're going to find Sarah. I think we're going to find answers. And I'm not sure they're the answers we expect."

They went inside. Dunham was at his desk, going through paperwork. He looked up when they entered.

"How'd it go with Kovacs?"

"He lawyered up," Matt said. "Not literally, but he kicked us off his property. Wouldn't consent to a search."

"Can't say I'm surprised." Dunham leaned back in his chair. "You get anything useful?"

"Enough for a warrant, I think." Matt pulled out his notebook. "Kovacs's truck matches the witness description—Travis remembered a dark blue Silverado with a decal on the back window. He was at the Rural King buying trail cameras to monitor his house and yard two hours before Sarah disappeared. And he just told us that Sarah's car wouldn't start because the starter was bad."

Dunham sat up straighter. "He said that?"

"Word for word. 'Her car wasn't starting right. The starter was bad.'"

"We knew the car wouldn't start because she called triple-A. We never took a close look at why," Dunham said slowly.

"I know."

"If it was tampered with, he's either the one who did it—"

"Or he knows who did," Brandon finished.

Dunham looked between them. "You think he's good for this?"

Matt hesitated. "I think there's enough to search his property. What we find there will tell us more."

"All right." Dunham pulled out his phone. "I'll call Judge Morrison. She's usually pretty quick on warrants if the evidence is solid. What are you asking for?"

"Full property search," Matt said. "House, barn, outbuildings, vehicles. We're also requesting copies of any trail camera footage from the past six months."

"She'll probably grant it. Might take a few hours to get the paperwork." Dunham started dialing. "What are you two going to do in the meantime?"

"You said you had the original case files ready?"

"Yeah, they're in the conference room. Everything we documented from the night Sarah disappeared through the end of May when we stopped active investigation."

"I'll go through those," Brandon said. "See if there's anything we missed."

Matt nodded. "I want to verify Kovacs's detail about the starter. Where's Sarah's car now?"

"Henderson's Towing and Storage, out on Highway 36. They've got a contract with the county for long-term storage of evidence vehicles. Sarah's car is still there—we never released it to the family since it's technically still evidence."

"Can you call ahead? Let them know I'm coming?"

"Sure thing." Dunham dialed another number.

Matt looked at Brandon. "You good here?"

"Yeah. Go."

Matt headed for the door, then paused. "Gray?"

Brandon looked up.

"If you see anything in those files—anything that doesn't fit—"

"I'll call you."

Matt nodded and left.

The drive to Henderson's took twenty minutes. The place sat on a flat stretch of highway, surrounded by chain-link fence topped with barbed wire. A trailer served as the office, and behind it Matt could see rows of vehicles in various states of disrepair—wrecks waiting for insurance claims, seized vehicles waiting for court dates, evidence waiting for trials that might never come.

A man in coveralls met him at the gate. "You the FBI agent Dunham called about?"

"That's right. Matt Ellis." He showed his badge.

"Carl Henderson. You're here about the Carpenter girl's car?"

"Yes sir."

Henderson unlocked the gate and led Matt through the yard. They passed a minivan with a caved-in driver's side, a motorcycle that looked like it had been dragged for a quarter mile, a pickup truck with its front end accordion-folded into the cab.

"Here she is." Henderson stopped in front of a red Honda Civic. License plate still attached, library bumper sticker still on the back. Dust covered the windows but otherwise it looked untouched, like Sarah had just parked it yesterday.

"Mind if I take a look?" Matt asked.

"Be my guest. Dunham said you might want to pop the hood."

"I would, yeah."

Henderson opened the driver's door and pulled the hood release. The hood lifted with a rusty squeal.

Matt leaned over the engine. He wasn't a mechanic, but he'd changed enough oil and replaced enough batteries to know the basics. The starter was visible near the bottom of the engine, connected to the flywheel.

He pulled out his phone and turned on the flashlight, angling it to get a better look.

There—on the electrical connection to the starter. The wire had been partially disconnected, just enough that it wouldn't make full contact. Not cut, not obviously damaged. Just loosened. Someone who knew what they were doing could do it in thirty seconds. And when Sarah turned the key, the engine would crank but not catch right away. The wire was still connected enough that it might catch eventually. Probably how she got it started at the library. But when she tried again at the Crossroads, nothing.

It wasn't an accident. It wasn't a mechanical failure.

Someone had sabotaged her car. Deliberately. Knowing she'd likely be stranded.

Matt took several photos, documenting the connection from multiple angles. Then he carefully reconnected the wire, making sure it was seated properly.

"You find what you needed?" Henderson asked.

"Yeah." Matt closed the hood. "Yeah, I did."

He stood there for a moment, looking at the car. Sarah's library badge still hung from the rearview mirror. A coffee cup in the cupholder. A book on the passenger seat—*The Handmaid's Tale* by Margaret Atwood.

She'd been twenty-two years old. She'd wanted to study English. She'd called her mom to say she'd be late.

And someone had made sure her car wouldn't start that night.

Matt's phone rang. Dunham.

"Ellis."

"Judge Morrison signed the warrant. We're good to go for Kovacs's property. When can you be back?"

Matt checked his watch. Eleven-thirty. "Give me thirty minutes."

"I'll have lunch waiting," Dunham said. "We can decide when and how to serve this."

Matt ended the call and looked at the Honda one more time. Dale Kovacs had known about the starter. He'd known exactly what was wrong with Sarah's car.

Which meant either he'd sabotaged it himself, or he'd seen who did.

Matt got back in his car and headed toward Rockville. The whole drive, he kept thinking about Dale's face when Brandon had stared at the barn. That look of fear. Of guilt.

Of failure.

Brandon was right. They weren't going to find what they expected when they searched that property.
