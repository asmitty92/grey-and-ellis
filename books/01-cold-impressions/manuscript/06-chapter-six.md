# Chapter Six
**Friday Afternoon**

Brandon sat in the conference room at the Parke County Sheriff's Department, waiting for Matt to return from Henderson's Towing. The original case files were spread across the table in front of him—witness statements, evidence logs, photos from the scene. He'd been through most of it in the hour Matt had been gone.

Deputy Kowalski's initial report was thorough. Times documented to the minute. Descriptions detailed. He'd canvassed the area around the Crossroads that night, knocked on doors at three nearby farmhouses, checked with Marv about customers who'd been in the store earlier that evening. Good police work.

Brandon stared at the photo of Sarah's purse on the ground by the payphone. Her keys were still in it. Wallet, lip balm, a library card with her photo, receipts from the grocery store and gas station. Everything you'd expect.

Everything except her cell phone.

The door opened. Matt came in, followed by Dunham. Both men looked grim.

"It was tampered with," Matt said without preamble. "The electrical connection to the starter was loosened. Not cut, not obviously damaged. Just disconnected enough that it would be intermittent. Sometimes it would catch, sometimes it wouldn't."

"That's how she got it started at the library but not at the Crossroads," Brandon said.

"Exactly." Matt sat down across from him. "Someone who knew what they were doing could do it in thirty seconds. And Dale Kovacs knew exactly what was wrong with that car."

Dunham leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed. "Judge Morrison signed the warrant an hour ago. Full property search—house, barn, outbuildings, vehicles, and any trail camera footage. Question is when we serve it."

"Today or tomorrow?" Matt asked.

"Your call. I can have deputies ready either way."

Brandon looked at the case files spread in front of him. Six months Sarah had been missing. Six months Dale had been sitting on that property, knowing what had happened. Another twelve hours wouldn't change anything.

"Tomorrow morning," Matt said. "Saturday. Dale's more likely to be home, less likely to have advance warning if anyone sees us staging."

Dunham nodded. "I'll have my team here at oh-seven-hundred. We'll brief and roll out by oh-seven-thirty. That puts us at his property by eight."

"Who are you bringing?" Matt asked.

"Me along with Deputies Harris, Michaels, and Kowalski. Harris is good with documentation—he'll photograph and video everything. Kowalski was first on scene back in April, he knows the case. Michaels can keep Kovacs in check. Plus it's a Saturday—most of my deputies are off."

"We'll need to call in forensics if we find what we think we're going to find," Matt said.

"ISP has a crime scene unit in Terre Haute. I'll give them a call, make sure they're on standby for tomorrow." Dunham pushed off the doorframe. "You two should get some rest. Tomorrow's going to be a long day."

After Dunham left, Matt turned to Brandon. "You find anything useful in those files?"

"Kowalski did good work that night. Thorough. Documented everything."

"But?"

Brandon tapped the photo of Sarah's purse. "We talked about this the other night, but her cell phone wasn't in here. It was found at the library a week later, in the stacks. The implication being she must have left it there during her workday."

"So?"

"So she called AAA from the payphone at the Crossroads. She would've used her cell if she'd had it with her. That's what anyone would do. You don't go straight to a payphone in 2010 unless you don't have your phone."

Matt thought about this. "You think someone made sure she didn't have it?"

"I think it's convenient for our perp that she didn't have. No cell phone means no GPS tracking, no call records from that night except the landline at the Crossroads."

"You think that was planned?"

Brandon closed the file folder. "I think tomorrow we're going to find out what Dale was planning. And whether he was planning it alone."

**Saturday Morning**

The sun was just starting to burn off the morning mist when they pulled onto County Road 275. Two vehicles—Matt driving the FBI sedan with Brandon in the passenger seat, Dunham following in his cruiser with Deputies Harris and Kowalski.

Brandon had been quiet during the drive from Rockville. He'd eaten breakfast mechanically, barely tasting it. His mind was already at that barn, already feeling the weight of what they were about to find.

Dale's truck was in the driveway when they arrived. Lights were on in the house. He was awake.

They parked and got out. The morning was cool and still. Brandon could see the barn beyond the house, its red paint weathered to rust in places. The door was closed.

Dunham knocked on the front door. Matt stood beside him, warrant folder in hand. Brandon hung back slightly, watching. Harris had a camera ready. Kowalski stood to the left of the door, hand resting near his duty weapon.

The door opened. Dale looked at all of them, taking in the vehicles, the uniforms, the expressions. His face went pale.

"Mr. Kovacs," Dunham said. "We have a warrant to search your property."

Dale's eyes moved from Dunham to Matt to the deputies. When his gaze landed on Kowalski, something flickered across his face—recognition, yes, but also something else. Fear, maybe. Or anger. His jaw tightened and he took a half-step back.

Brandon watched this carefully. Dale had no reaction to Harris. But Kowalski made him flinch.

"Can I see it?" Dale's voice was hoarse, like he'd been expecting this but hoping it wouldn't come.

Matt handed him the warrant. Dale's hands shook slightly as he read it. He didn't read carefully—just scanned it, looking for the scope. House, barn, outbuildings, vehicles. Everything.

"I want to call my lawyer," Dale said quietly.

"You're not under arrest," Matt said. "But you're welcome to call anyone you want. We're going to execute this warrant now."

Dale stepped back from the door, pulling it open wider. "It's not what you think."

"What do we think, Mr. Kovacs?" Dunham asked.

Dale looked at all of them again. His eyes lingered on Kowalski. "Y'all think I hurt her. I didn't. I was trying to help."

"Help who?" Matt asked.

Dale's mouth worked but no sound came out. Finally he just shook his head. "I want my lawyer."

"That's your right," Dunham said. "You can wait in your living room or outside. Deputy Michaels will stay with you. The rest of us are going to search your property now."

Dunham looked at Matt, then at Brandon. "How do you want to split up?"

Brandon spoke before Matt could. "I'll take the barn."

Matt studied him for a moment, then nodded. "I'll start with the house. Dunham, you want to coordinate?"

Kowalski spoke up quickly, "I'll take the barn with Agent Gray."

"Ok. Harris, you're with Matt for documentation." Dunham turned to Dale. "Keys to the barn?"

"It's not locked."

"Any animals in there we should know about?"

"A couple of old barn cats. But they won't bother ya." Dale's voice was barely a whisper.

They separated. Brandon walked toward the barn with Kowalski beside him. The deputy was quiet, his expression professional but curious. Brandon could feel him watching.

The barn door wasn't locked, just as Dale had said. Brandon pulled it open. The hinges creaked. Light spilled into the interior, illuminating dust motes in the air.

The space was mostly empty. Some old equipment against the far wall—a rusted plow, milk cans, a workbench cluttered with tools. The floor was hard-packed dirt. Overhead, the loft was accessible by a ladder, but it looked undisturbed.

Brandon stood just inside the doorway, letting his eyes adjust. Letting himself feel.

The impression hit him immediately, the same one he'd felt two days ago. Trauma. Terror. Death. It saturated the space like a stain.

Brandon's eyes moved to the southeast corner of the barn, near where the workbench stood. The dirt there was slightly darker, slightly more disturbed.

He could almost see it—a woman on the ground, struggling. Hands at her throat. The desperate need to do something, anything, to leave evidence. To make sure someone would know she'd been here.

He walked toward it.

"What are you looking for?" Kowalski asked from behind him.

"Evidence," Brandon said simply.

He knelt by the dark patch of dirt. Up close, it was clear that something had happened here. The ground was compressed in a pattern that didn't match the rest of the floor. Something had happened in this area. And the ground had been soft when it had.

Brandon pulled a pair of latex gloves from his pocket and put them on. He produced a small flashlight to illuminate the ground and started combing the area gently with his fingers.

"You see something?" Kowalski moved closer.

"Maybe."

Brandon took out his switchblade and pushed the thumb slide. The blade punched forward and locked open. Using the knife, he began moving dirt carefully, methodically. Two inches down, he saw a glint of metal. He worked around it, exposing more of the object.

A bracelet. Silver, delicate, partially tarnished. It had been buried deliberately, pressed down into the soft earth.

Brandon pulled it free and held it up to the light. It was distinctive—a charm bracelet with several small pendants. A book. A musical note. A tiny heart with initials he couldn't quite make out.

She'd tried to leave evidence. Some victims did that—knowing they might not survive, they tried to make sure someone would know they'd been there. Brandon understood that impulse better than he wanted to.

"How did you know that was there?" Kowalski's voice had an edge to it now. Suspicion.

Brandon looked at him. Kowalski was staring at the bracelet. He wasn't surprised at the find. He was more concerned with the how.

"I didn't," Brandon said. "I was searching for evidence. I found some."

He stood, placing the bracelet carefully in an evidence bag he'd brought from the car. He sealed it, marked it with the date and location.

Kowalski was still watching him. "You just happened to dig in the exact right spot?"

"The dirt was disturbed here. It stood out."

It wasn't entirely a lie. The dirt was disturbed in that area.

He turned and walked back toward the barn door, the bagged bracelet in his hand. Behind him, he heard Kowalski's footsteps following.

As they emerged into the morning sunlight, Brandon glanced back at the barn. The impression was still there—fading now, but not gone. Something terrible had happened in that barn.

---

Brandon walked toward the house, the evidence bag in his hand. Through the front window, he could see Matt, Harris, and Dunham in what looked like a hallway, both of them staring at something. Matt was taking photos with his phone.

Dale sat on the front porch steps, Deputy Michaels standing a few feet away. Dale's head was in his hands. When Brandon walked past, Dale looked up. His eyes went to the evidence bag, then to Brandon's face.

"Where was it?" Dale's voice was barely audible.

Brandon didn't answer. He climbed the porch steps and went inside.

The house was neat but sparse. Living room with an old couch and a television. Kitchen visible through a doorway, clean dishes in the rack by the sink. The hallway led to what Brandon assumed were bedrooms.

Matt and Dunham stood outside a door at the end of the hall. The door had a deadbolt on the outside.

"Gray," Matt said when he saw him. "You need to see this."

Brandon walked down the hall. The door was open now. Inside was a small bedroom—maybe ten by twelve feet. A twin bed with the sheets pulled back. A nightstand with a lamp. A dresser.

But it was the details that told the story.

A chain bolted to the floor near the bed, long enough to reach the attached bathroom but not the door. Empty water bottles in a trash can. Granola bar wrappers. A paperback novel on the nightstand—*Jane Eyre*.

And on the dresser, a hair tie. Long blonde strands still caught in the elastic.

"Jesus," Brandon said quietly.

"There's more." Matt gestured to the bathroom. "Toothbrush in there. Women's shampoo. She was here for at least a few days."

Dunham was taking notes. "We'll need ISP forensics to confirm the hair is Sarah's, but this is enough to arrest him. This is a crime scene."

Brandon held up the evidence bag with the bracelet. "Found this in the barn. Buried in the dirt in the southeast corner."

Matt took the bag, studying the bracelet through the plastic. "Charm bracelet. That's specific enough that Sarah's mother could probably identify it."

"It was pushed into the ground," Brandon said. "Almost definitely deliberately buried."

Dunham looked at him sharply. "How do you know it was deliberate?"

"The way it was positioned, almost two inches deep. Someone pushed it down and covered it."

Matt was still examining the bracelet. "If this is Sarah's, and it was in the barn..." He looked at Brandon. "She was kept in the house but later moved to the barn?"

"That's what the evidence suggests."

"Why move her?" Dunham asked. "If he had her locked up here, why take her to the barn?"

Brandon looked back at the bedroom. The chain. The water bottles. The book. Someone had been kept here, but not violently. Not in squalor. The room was clean. There was food, water, reading material.

"He wasn't torturing her," Brandon said. "This looks like he wanted her to be comfortable. Safe."

"Safe from what?" Matt asked.

"Or from who," Brandon said quietly.

Dunham pulled out his phone. "I'm calling ISP. We need a full crime scene team here. This is beyond what we can process ourselves." He stepped into the hallway to make the call.

Matt moved closer to Brandon, lowering his voice. "You found that bracelet pretty fast. How?"

"The dirt was disturbed in that corner."

"You didn't have time to search the whole barn. You went right to that spot. The same spot you went to the other day."

Brandon met his eyes. "Sometimes you get lucky."

Matt held his gaze for a moment, then nodded slowly. He didn't believe it was luck, but he wasn't going to push. Not here. Not now.

Dunham came back into the room. "ISP is sending a team. They'll be here in ninety minutes. In the meantime, we secure the scene and arrest Kovacs."

"On what charge?" Matt asked.

"Kidnapping at minimum. We've got evidence someone was held here against their will and every reason to believe it was Sarah. Forensics will confirm it, but we can arrest him on what we have now." Dunham looked around the room one more time. "This changes things. Dale Kovacs has been sitting on this property for six months knowing Sarah Carpenter was here."

"But she's not here now," Brandon said. "And if she died in the barn, where's her body?"

The question hung in the air. Matt looked at Brandon, and Brandon saw the realization forming.

"He moved her," Matt said. "After she died, he moved her body."

"Someone did," Brandon said.

Dunham frowned. "You think there's another person involved?"

"I think there's quite a bit more to this than we know right now," Brandon said. "We need to ask Dale Kovacs some very specific questions."

They walked back outside. Dale was still sitting on the porch steps, his head in his hands. When he heard them coming, he looked up. His eyes were red.

Dunham stepped forward. "Dale Kovacs, you're under arrest for the kidnapping of Sarah Carpenter. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law..."

Dale didn't resist as Harris pulled him to his feet and cuffed him. He just stood there, looking at the house, then at the barn, then at nothing.

"I tried to protect her," he said quietly. "I tried."

"Protect her from what?" Matt asked.

Dale shook his head. "Not without a lawyer."

"Where is she, Dale?" Brandon asked. His voice was very quiet. "Where's Sarah?"

Dale looked at him. For a moment, Brandon thought he might answer. But then Dale's expression closed, and he looked away.

"I need my lawyer," he said again.

Harris led Dale to the cruiser and placed him in the back seat. Dunham turned to Matt and Brandon.

"I'll process him at the station. You two stay here until ISP arrives. Make sure no one contaminates the scene." He paused. "Good work. Both of you. We've got him."

But as Dunham drove away with Dale in custody, Brandon stood looking at the barn. They had Dale, yes. They had evidence. They had a crime scene.

But they didn't have Sarah.

And Brandon had a feeling that when they found out what really happened in that barn, everything they thought they knew about this case was going to fall apart.

---

Kowalski had been standing near his own vehicle during the arrest, watching but not participating. Now he walked over to where Brandon stood.

"Hell of a find in that barn," Kowalski said. His tone was conversational, but his eyes were sharp. "How'd you know where to dig?"

Brandon looked at him. "The dirt was disturbed."

"Right. The dirt." Kowalski's smile didn't reach his eyes. "You FBI guys must have good training."

"We do our job."

"That you do." Kowalski glanced at the barn, then back at Brandon. "You think he killed her in there? Sarah?"

"The bracelet suggests she was there."

"But no body."

"Not yet."

Kowalski nodded slowly. "Well, I hope you find her. Sarah deserves better than this. Her family deserves answers." He turned to leave, then paused. "You know, I was first on scene the night she disappeared. Talked to Travis Walton right after he called it in. I've been thinking about this case for six months."

"I'm sure you have," Brandon said.

"Yeah." Kowalski's expression was unreadable. "I'm sure we all have."

He walked back to his vehicle to wait for the ISP team.

Matt came up beside him. "ISP will be here soon. We should document what we can before they take over."

"Yeah."

"You okay?"

Brandon looked at his partner. "I think Dale was telling the truth. He was trying to protect her."

"From what?"

"I don't know yet." Brandon turned back toward the barn. "But whoever he was protecting her from—that's who killed her."

Matt followed his gaze. "And that person is still out there."

"Yes," Brandon said quietly. "They are."
