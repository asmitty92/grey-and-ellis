# Chapter Seven
**Saturday Afternoon**

Matt stood in the observation room, watching Dale Kovacs through the one-way glass. Dale sat at a metal table in Interview Room One, hands folded in front of him, still wearing the same flannel shirt and jeans from this morning. He hadn't said a word since arriving at the station two hours ago. Just sat there, staring at the table, waiting for his lawyer.

Brandon stood beside Matt, silent. He'd been like that since they'd left Dale's property—present but distant, processing everything they'd found.

The ISP crime scene unit had arrived right on schedule. They'd taken over the house and barn, photographing everything, collecting samples, documenting the scene with the kind of methodical precision that took hours. Matt and Brandon had given their statements about what they'd found, turned over the bracelet, and left them to their work.

Now came the hard part.

"You think he'll talk?" Matt asked.

Brandon's eyes never left Dale. "He wants to. He's been carrying this for six months."

"But?"

"But he's scared. And he should be."

The door to the interview room opened. A man in his late fifties walked in, carrying a worn leather briefcase. Salt-and-pepper hair, rumpled gray suit, wire-rimmed glasses. He had the look of a small-town attorney who'd been practicing in Parke County for thirty years—competent, cautious, and probably handling everything from wills to DUIs to the occasional criminal defense.

Dale looked up when the lawyer entered. Relief washed over his face.

"That's Gerald Hicks," Brandon said. "Local attorney. Does a little bit of everything. He's not a criminal defense specialist, but he's competent."

"You looked him up?"

"While we were waiting for ISP. Wanted to know who we'd be dealing with."

Matt watched as Hicks sat down next to Dale and opened his briefcase. They spoke in low tones, Hicks asking questions, Dale answering with short nods or shakes of his head. After about five minutes, Hicks closed his briefcase and looked directly at the mirror.

"That's our cue," Matt said.

They walked down the hall and entered the interview room. Matt carried a folder with Dale's arrest report, photos from the scene, and the preliminary notes from ISP. Brandon carried nothing but his notebook and a pen.

Dale looked up when they entered. His eyes were red-rimmed but focused. Hicks straightened in his chair, projecting professional competence.

"Agents," Hicks said, nodding. "Gerald Hicks, representing Mr. Kovacs. I understand you're here to discuss the charges against my client."

Matt sat down across from Dale and Brandon took the chair beside him. Matt placed the folder on the table but didn't open it.

"Mr. Kovacs has been arrested for kidnapping," Matt said. "We found evidence at his property that Sarah Carpenter was held there against her will. We also found what appears to be her bracelet buried in his barn. We have questions."

"My client is willing to cooperate," Hicks said carefully. "But I need to make something clear. Mr. Kovacs did not harm Sarah Carpenter. He did not kill her. What he did, he did with the intention of protecting her."

Matt kept his expression neutral. "Protecting her from what?"

Hicks looked at Dale, who nodded slightly.

"From someone who wanted to hurt her," Hicks said.

"Who?"

Dale's jaw tightened. He looked at his lawyer, then at Matt. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse. "I can't say. Not yet."

Brandon leaned forward slightly. "Can't or won't?"

"Can't." Dale's hands flexed on the table. "Not until I know it's safe."

Matt opened the folder and pulled out a photo of Sarah. "Then tell us what you can. Start from the beginning."

Dale stared at the photo for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was quiet. "About a year ago—late October or early November—I started noticing signs that someone had been on my property. In my barn, specifically. Little things. Tools moved. An old blanket I kept in the loft pulled down. Footprints in the dust that weren't mine."

"Did you report this to the sheriff?" Matt asked.

"No. At first I thought maybe I was imagining it. But it kept happening. Always when I was away from the property or asleep. Whoever it was, they knew when I wouldn't be there."

"What made you think it was a person and not an animal?"

"The way things were disturbed. Deliberate. Like someone was... visiting." Dale's jaw tightened. "I had a suspicion who it might be, but I couldn't be sure."

"So you bought the trail cameras," Brandon said.

"Not at first. It was harmless, and it stopped when winter set in."

"When did you get worried?" asked Matt.

"When the spring thaw came, it started happening more often. It got to a point that I needed to know if I was right."

"So you went to Rural King and bought the cameras," Matt stated looking up from his notebook.

Dale nodded. "April sixteenth. I went to the Rural King after work, bought four cameras. Planned to set them up the next morning to see if I could catch whoever was coming around."

Matt made a note. "Why wait until morning?"

"It was already getting dark when I got home. And I wanted to place them carefully—figure out the best angles. I wasn't in a rush." Dale's voice dropped. "Maybe I should have been."

"What happened the next morning?"

"I woke up early. Around six-thirty. Grabbed the cameras and headed out to the barn to start setting them up." Dale's hands were shaking now. "That's when I found her."

The room went quiet. Matt could hear the hum of the fluorescent lights overhead, the distant sound of phones ringing in the main office.

"Sarah," Matt said.

Dale nodded. "She was in the southeast corner of the barn. Chained to one of the support posts. On a makeshift bed made from blankets, soft ones...not the type I keep in the barn. She was unconscious. I thought she was dead at first, but then I saw her breathing."

"What did you do?"

"I checked for a pulse. She was alive but unresponsive. Her pupils were dilated—I thought maybe she'd been drugged." Dale wiped his face. "I got the chain off her—used a crowbar to break the padlock—and carried her to the house."

"You didn't call 911," Brandon said. Not a question.

"No. I—" Dale stopped, searching for words. "I knew who had done this. And I knew if I called the police, he'd find out. He'd come back."

"Who would come back?" Matt asked.

Dale shook his head. "I can't say. Not here."

"Mr. Kovacs, if you know who took Sarah—"

"I said I can't." Dale's voice rose slightly, then he forced himself to calm down. "I need you to understand. The person who did this—if I say their name, they'll know I talked. And I can't... I can't put myself at risk like that. Not yet."

Matt exchanged a glance with Brandon. Saw that Brandon had also recognized the fear in Dale's voice.

"All right," Matt said carefully. "Tell us what happened after you brought her inside."

Dale took a shaky breath. "I put her in the spare bedroom. Called someone I know, a nurse. I knew she wouldn't ask questions. She came, examined her. Said she'd most likely been drugged with something strong, probably a benzodiazepine. She told me to keep her comfortable, said she'd come around in a few hours."

"Did the nurse report this?"

"No. I asked her not to. She's...an old friend." Dale's voice was tight with shame. "I told myself I was protecting Sarah. That I needed time to figure out what to do. I didn't think anyone would believe I just found her there."

"How long was she there?" Brandon asked.

"Three days." Dale's hands clenched. "She woke up the second day. She was terrified. Didn't remember much about what happened at the Crossroads—just fragments. The drugs had messed with her memory. She thought I was the one who'd taken her."

"Did you try to explain?"

"I did. But how do you explain something like that? 'I found you chained in my barn, so I brought you to my house and locked you in a bedroom'?" Dale's voice cracked. "She didn't believe me. She kept asking me to let her go, to call her mother. I told her I would, that I just needed to keep her safe a little longer."

Matt made notes, his mind working through the timeline. "What happened on the third day?"

Dale's face went pale. "I had a job. County maintenance work in Rockville. I'd already missed two days—if I didn't show up, I'd lose the contract. I thought she'd be safe. I'd set up the cameras by then, had them running. I figured if anyone came near the property, I'd know."

"But someone did come," Brandon said quietly.

"I checked the cameras when I got home around six-thirty. Someone had been there around two PM." Dale's voice shook. "The camera facing the house caught a vehicle pulling onto the property. Couldn't see details—too far away, wrong angle. But whoever it was went straight to the house. Broke the lock on the bedroom door and took her."

"Took her where?"

"The barn. The camera facing that direction caught them—just shapes, movement. I could see he was dragging her. She was fighting though, fully conscious. But he was bigger, stronger." Dale stopped, his breathing shallow. "They went inside the barn. The camera didn't show the interior. But I listened to the audio later. I heard her screaming. Then nothing."

Matt felt his chest tighten. "You got home after she was already dead."

Dale nodded, tears streaming down his face now. "I ran to the barn as soon as I saw the bedroom chain broken. She was in the southeast corner. He'd strangled her. There was dirt under her fingernails where she'd tried to claw at the ground. To leave evidence, maybe. To let someone know she'd been there."

Brandon's voice was barely audible. "The bracelet."

"It was still on her wrist when I found her. But it was loose—like she'd been trying to get it off, to leave it behind." Dale wiped his eyes. "I pulled it free and buried it where she'd been clawing. Kinda felt like I was carrying out her last wish by doing it."

"What did you do with her body?" Matt asked.

Dale was silent for a long moment. "I buried her. In the back pasture, under the oak tree near the property line. I know I should have called the police. But I was terrified. If they found her on my property, in my barn, after I'd kept her in my house—" His voice broke. "They'd never believe I was trying to protect her. And the person who killed her would walk free."

"Where's the trail camera footage now?"

"I deleted it. After I buried her." Dale looked at Matt directly. "I pulled the SD cards and destroyed them. I couldn't risk anyone finding them."

Matt leaned back in his chair. "Let me see if I understand this correctly. Someone you knew took Sarah from the Crossroads, drugged her, and left her in your barn. You found her, brought her into your house. Three days later, this same person came back, took her to the barn, and killed her. You buried her body and destroyed the evidence. And now you're refusing to tell us who this person is because you're afraid."

"Yes."

"Mr. Kovacs, withholding information in a murder investigation—"

"Is a crime. I know." Dale's jaw set. "But so is being an accessory. And that's what I'd be if I say anything more right now."

Hicks cleared his throat. "My client is willing to continue cooperating, but he has legitimate concerns about his safety. Perhaps if we could arrange for him to be held somewhere other than the county jail—"

"He's afraid of someone in local law enforcement," Brandon said. It wasn't a question.

The room went silent. Dale didn't confirm it, but he didn't deny it either.

Matt closed the folder. "We'll need to recover Sarah's body. You'll have to show us where you buried her."

"I will. Tomorrow. In daylight." Dale looked between them. "But I need your word that you'll keep me safe. That you won't let certain people know what I've told you."

"Who specifically?" Matt asked.

Dale shook his head. "Anyone who was involved in the original investigation. Anyone who had access to the files, the evidence, the witness statements."

Matt thought about that. The original investigation had been handled by Dunham and Kowalski. But a rural sheriff's office isn't compartmentalized. Every deputy in the station has full access to everything on this case. If Dale was afraid of someone in law enforcement, someone who knew where he lived, someone who could recognize his truck from security footage—

"We'll keep you in protective custody," Matt said. "Federal holding, not county. And we'll limit who knows the details of your statement."

Dale nodded slowly. "Thank you."

"But Mr. Kovacs," Matt leaned forward, his voice firm. "Eventually, you're going to have to tell us who killed Sarah Carpenter. Because right now, you're our only suspect. And you've already admitted to holding someone against their will and disposing of their body. It wouldn't be a leap to convince a jury you're guilty of the murder too. If you want that to change, you need to help us find the real killer."

"I know." Dale's voice was barely a whisper. "I just need time. Need to know it's safe."

Hicks gathered his papers. "I think that's enough for today. My client has cooperated extensively. He's told you where to find the victim's remains. He's explained his actions, however misguided they may have been. Pushing him further right now isn't going to help anyone."

Matt stood. "We'll arrange transport to a federal facility. You'll be there tonight."

After they left the interview room, Matt and Brandon walked back to the observation room. Through the glass, they could see Dale sitting with his head in his hands, Hicks speaking to him quietly.

"He knows exactly who killed her," Brandon said.

"Yeah."

"Someone in law enforcement. Someone who had access to the investigation. Someone who knew Dale's property well enough to use that barn."

"Someone who recognized Dale's truck in the security footage and figured out where Sarah was."

They stood in silence for a moment, both of them thinking through the implications.

"Kowalski was first on scene," Matt said quietly. "He ran the initial investigation with Dunham. He had access to everything."

"And he was in the barn with me this morning," Brandon added. "Watching me find that bracelet. Asking how I knew where to dig."

"But Dale's been afraid of this person for six months. If it's Kowalski, why didn't he just leave town? Why stay here where they could run into each other?"

"Maybe he couldn't leave. The property, his job—everything he has is here." Brandon turned away from the glass. "Or maybe he's been watching. Making sure the person who killed Sarah doesn't hurt anyone else."

Matt pulled out his phone. "I'm calling the bureau field office in Indianapolis. We need to get Dale out of this building and into protective custody before anyone knows what he told us."

"And then?"

"Then we figure out who else had access to that barn. Who knew Dale well enough to know that's where he'd keep someone. Who Sarah would have known from when she was younger." Matt started dialing. "Because Dale's story has holes in it. Things he's not telling us. And the only way we're going to find the truth is to dig into Dale's past."

Brandon looked back through the glass at Dale. "He's protecting someone. Even now."

"I know."

"Which means it's someone he cares about. Someone he has history with."

Matt held the phone to his ear, waiting for an answer on the other end. "Family, maybe. Or close to it."

Brandon didn't respond, but Matt saw the slight nod. They were both thinking the same thing.

Whoever killed Sarah Carpenter wasn't a stranger to Dale Kovacs.

They were someone he knew.

Someone he'd maybe even loved.
