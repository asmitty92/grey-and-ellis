# Chapter Eight
**Sunday Morning**

Brandon stood at the edge of Dale Kovacs's back pasture, watching the forensics team work. The oak tree rose from the fence line like a sentinel—massive trunk, gnarled branches, the kind of tree that had been there for a century and would be there for another if someone didn't cut it down.

Beneath it, the ISP crime scene unit had marked off a grid with stakes and string. A ground-penetrating radar unit sat nearby, its operator having already confirmed what Dale had told them: there was a disruption in the soil consistent with a burial approximately six feet down, roughly five feet from the tree's trunk on the eastern side.

The sun had been up for maybe an hour. The morning air was cold enough that Brandon could see his breath. Matt stood twenty yards away with Chief Deputy Dunham, both of them watching the excavation begin. Dale was still in federal custody in Indianapolis—they'd transported him last night and he'd be there until they figured out who he was afraid of.

Brandon's phone buzzed. A text from Matt: *Dunham wants to know if you need to be here for this.*

Brandon typed back: *No. Would rather start on background.*

Matt looked up from his phone, caught Brandon's eye, and nodded. He said something to Dunham, then walked over.

"Dunham's going to supervise the recovery," Matt said. "ISP has it under control. He said we can use the conference room at the station to work."

"Good." Brandon turned away from the excavation. He didn't need to watch them dig up Sarah Carpenter's body. He'd already felt what happened to her in that barn. Watching them pull her remains from the ground wouldn't tell him anything he didn't already know.

They walked back to where they'd parked near Dale's house. The property looked different in daylight with no one living there—abandoned, waiting. Yellow crime scene tape still cordoned off the barn and the house. A single sheriff's cruiser sat in the driveway, Deputy Harris inside doing a security check.

Matt drove them back to Rockville. Neither spoke for the first few minutes. Brandon stared out the window at the farmland rolling past, his mind already working through what they needed to find.

"Dale's protecting someone he has history with," Matt said finally. "Someone who knew that barn well enough to use it. Someone who could visit the property without Dale immediately suspecting."

"Family," Brandon said. "Or close to it."

"So we start with Dale's family. See who's connected to him. Who would have spent time on that property."

Brandon pulled out his notebook. "Marriage records. Divorce records. Property history. We need to know everyone who's lived at that address in the last twenty years."

They reached the sheriff's station at eight-fifteen. The Sunday morning shift was minimal—just a dispatcher and Deputy Michaels doing paperwork in the bullpen. Dunham had called ahead; the conference room was unlocked and waiting for them.

Brandon set up his laptop on the table and connected to the mobile hotspot on his phone. Matt pulled out a legal pad and started making a list of what they needed.

"County clerk's office is closed Sundays," Matt said. "But we can access marriage and divorce records online through the state database if we have the right credentials."

"I'll call the Indianapolis field office," Brandon said. "Get us access."

While Brandon made the call, Matt pulled up the Parke County property records on his phone. Dale Kovacs had owned the property on County Road 275 since 1994—purchased June 1994. Before that, the property had been owned by someone named Eugene Kovacs, likely Dale's father.

Brandon ended his call. "Indianapolis is setting us up with access. Should have it in thirty minutes."

"Dale bought the property in '94," Matt said. "He'd be what, twenty-nine years old then?"

"Sounds right."

"Young to buy a farm. Wonder if it was a family thing—inheritance, parents selling to him cheap."

Brandon made a note. "We should find out if Dale has siblings. If so, where they are now."

Matt's phone rang. He glanced at the screen. "It's Dunham." He answered, putting it on speaker. "Ellis."

"We've got her," Dunham's voice came through, flat and professional. "ISP confirmed it's human remains, approximately the right time frame. They're transporting to the state lab in Terre Haute for identification and autopsy. Preliminary observation suggests cause of death consistent with strangulation."

"How long until we get a formal ID?" Matt asked.

"Dental records, probably twenty-four to forty-eight hours. But it's her. Everything matches—location, condition, clothing, timeframe."

Brandon felt that familiar heaviness settle in his chest. Sarah Carpenter, twenty-two years old, who wanted to study English and become a librarian. Who called her mother to say she'd be late. Who died trying to leave evidence so someone would know what happened to her.

"Thanks for the update," Matt said.

"I'm heading back to the station now. You boys find anything yet?"

"Working on it. We'll keep you posted."

After Dunham hung up, Matt set his phone down. "At least her mother will have closure. Eventually."

Brandon didn't respond. Anyone who'd lost someone violently knew closure was a myth. Closure was what people said when they didn't know what else to offer. Linda Carpenter would get her daughter's body back, but she'd never get Sarah back. That wasn't closure. That was just the end of waiting.

His mind flashed to Ashford, Missouri. To a payphone. Where the waiting had never ended.

His laptop chimed. The email from Indianapolis with database access credentials.

Brandon logged into the Indiana vital records system and pulled up Parke County marriage licenses. He typed in "Dale Kovacs" and hit search.

One result. Dale Richard Kovacs married to Jennifer Anne Harding, March 12, 1994.

"He was married," Brandon said.

Matt moved to look over his shoulder. "March '94. Three months before he bought the property."

Brandon clicked through to the divorce records database. Dale Richard Kovacs and Jennifer Anne Harding, divorced December 8, 2003.

"Divorced in 2003," Brandon said. "They were married nine years."

"Any kids listed?"

Brandon scanned the divorce decree. "No biological children mentioned. But—" He stopped, reading closer. "There's a notation about custody arrangements for a minor child, but it's listed as 'stepchild.' No name given in this document."

"So Jennifer had a kid from a previous relationship," Matt said. "That kid would have lived on Dale's property during the marriage."

"From 1994 to 2003," Brandon confirmed. "Nine years. Long enough to know that barn inside and out."

Matt pulled out his phone. "I'll see if I can find Jennifer Harding on social media. Maybe she remarried, changed her name."

While Matt searched, Brandon pulled up property tax records. The Kovacs property showed two residents from 1994 to 2003: Dale R. Kovacs and Jennifer A. Kovacs. After 2003, just Dale.

"Found her," Matt said. "Jennifer Harding-Powell. Lives in Bloomington now. Looks like she remarried in 2005. She's got a Facebook page, pretty active. Lots of photos."

"Of a son?"

"Multiple kids actually. Looks like she had at least two sons." Matt was scrolling through photos. "Here's an older photo from 2008. Jennifer with a younger son at his high school graduation. Caption says 'So proud of my Tyler graduating from Bloomington High South.' And then there are older photos—wait, here. From 1997. Jennifer and Dale with two boys. The younger one looks maybe seven or eight. The older one's a teenager."

Brandon moved to look at Matt's phone. The photo was faded-a scan of an old physical photo. It showed Jennifer and Dale standing with two boys in front of what looked like Dale's barn. The younger boy—Tyler, presumably—smiled at the camera. The older boy, maybe fifteen or sixteen, stood slightly apart, arms crossed, not quite looking at the camera.

"Two stepsons," Brandon said. "The younger one stayed with Jennifer after the divorce. What about the older one?"

"No recent photos of him that I can find. Last one I see is from 2001—him in what looks like a church youth group photo. He'd be maybe eighteen or nineteen there."

"So he was already an adult when the divorce happened," Matt said. "Or close to it. Old enough to leave on his own."

Brandon pulled up a new search window. "We need to find out who Jennifer was married to before Dale. The biological father of these kids."

"Start with obituaries," Matt suggested. "If he's dead, that would explain why Jennifer was a single mother when she married Dale."

Brandon typed "Jennifer Harding" plus "husband" plus "obituary" plus "Indiana."

Several results came up. He clicked on one from 1992: *Robert James Harding, 34, of Blackburn, Indiana, passed away after a brief battle with cancer. He is survived by his wife Jennifer and sons Marcus, 10, and Tyler, 2.*

Marcus.

"Marcus Harding," Brandon said. "Ten years old in 1992. That would make him twenty-nine now."

Matt leaned over to read the screen. "Father died when he was ten. Two years later, his mother marries Dale. He goes from losing his father to having a stepfather, moving to a new property."

"Formative years," Brandon said quietly. "That barn could have been his space. His refuge, maybe."

"And then the marriage falls apart when he's twenty-one. He's an adult by then, but that property—that barn specifically—would still feel like his."

Brandon opened a new search tab. "Marcus Harding" plus "Indiana."

Dozens of results. Common name. Too many to narrow down without more information.

"We need more specifics," Brandon said. "Where did he go after the divorce? What's he doing now?"

"Military records, college enrollment, employment history," Matt said. "Or we could just call Jennifer and ask."

Brandon shook his head. "If Marcus is our guy and he's still in contact with his mother, that would tip him off that we're looking at him."

"Fair point." Matt thought for a moment. "What about church records? You saw that photo from 2001—he was in a youth group. If he was active in church as a teenager, there might be records of where he went, what he did."

"Which church?"

"Thorndale only has two. We could check both."

Brandon checked his watch. Nine-thirty on a Sunday morning. Churches would be in service now. "We'd have to wait until afternoon to get into their offices."

"Or we could talk to people after service," Matt said. "See if anyone remembers Marcus Harding from the youth group ten or twelve years ago."

Brandon didn't like that approach. Too visible, too many people who might mention it to the wrong person. But they needed information, and they needed it quickly.

"Let's do general victim background first," Brandon said. "Talk to Sarah's mother. See what we can learn about Sarah's life, her connections. If Marcus knew her, there might be some overlap we can find."

Matt nodded. "Linda Carpenter. She lives in Thorndale. We should tell her about finding Sarah anyway."

They drove to Thorndale in silence. The town was quiet—a few cars parked outside the church on Main Street, some early morning walkers, not much else. Linda Carpenter lived on Oak Street, a modest ranch house with faded blue siding and white trim. The lawn was neat, flower beds mulched for winter. A car sat in the driveway—an older Nissan sedan, well-maintained.

Matt knocked on the door. They waited.

The woman who answered was in her late forties, dark blonde hair going gray at the temples, blue eyes like Sarah's. She wore jeans and a Purdue sweatshirt. When she saw their badges, something in her face changed—hope and dread mixed together.

"Mrs. Carpenter?" Matt said gently. "I'm Special Agent Ellis, this is Special Agent Gray. We're with the FBI. May we come in?"

Linda's hand went to her throat. "You found her."

It wasn't a question.

"Yes ma'am," Matt said. "We found Sarah's remains. I'm very sorry for your loss."

Linda didn't cry. She just nodded slowly, like she'd been expecting this for six months and was relieved to finally know. "Come in."

The living room was small and tidy. Photos covered every surface—Sarah as a baby, as a child, at her high school graduation, at the library. A shrine to a daughter who'd never come home.

They sat on the couch. Linda took the armchair across from them, her hands folded in her lap.

"Where was she?" Linda asked. Her voice was steady, controlled.

"On a property south of town," Matt said. "We've arrested someone in connection with her death. We're working to identify everyone involved."

"Who?"

"I can't say yet. The investigation is ongoing."

Linda's jaw tightened, but she nodded. "What do you need from me?"

Brandon pulled out his notebook. "We're trying to build a complete picture of Sarah's life. Who she knew, where she spent time, what was important to her. Sometimes connections that don't seem relevant turn out to matter."

"Where should I start?"

"Tell us about Sarah growing up," Matt said. "What was she like as a child?"

Linda's expression softened. "She was sweet. Quiet. Always reading. Her father used to joke that she'd read the phone book if we didn't keep her supplied with library books." Her voice caught on "father."

"Your husband passed away?" Brandon asked gently.

"Eleven years ago. Heart attack. Completely unexpected. He was only forty-two." Linda wiped her eyes. "Sarah was eleven. She took it very hard. They were close—he was the one who got her interested in books, who'd take her to the library every week."

Brandon made a note. Sarah's father had died when she was eleven. A traumatic loss at a formative age.

"How did Sarah cope?" Matt asked.

"Not well at first. She withdrew for a while. Stopped spending time with friends, just wanted to stay in her room and read. I took her to a counselor, but she wouldn't talk much. Said she was fine, but I knew she wasn't." Linda's hands twisted in her lap. "Then after about six months, she seemed to come out of it a little. Started going back to church youth group, reconnected with some friends."

"Did anyone help her through that time?" Brandon asked. "A friend, a mentor, someone at church?"

Linda thought for a moment. "The youth pastor at the time—Pastor Jim—he was good with the kids. He'd check in on Sarah, make sure she was doing okay. And there were some older kids in the youth group who were kind to her. I remember thinking how nice it was that the teenagers were looking out for the younger kids."

"Do you remember any of those teenagers specifically?"

"Not really. There were so many over the years." Linda paused. "Wait—there was one boy. I never knew his name, but Sarah mentioned once that he'd been talking to her a lot at youth group. Asking about her dad, how she was handling it. I thought it was sweet at first."

"At first?" Matt prompted.

"Sarah came to me about six months later—she would have been twelve by then—and said the boy made her uncomfortable. That he was always watching her, always trying to sit next to her, always asking personal questions. She asked if she could skip youth group for a while."

Brandon kept his voice level. "What did you do?"

"I talked to Pastor Jim about it. Told him Sarah felt uncomfortable with one of the older boys but didn't want to name names. He said he'd keep an eye on things, make sure everyone felt safe." Linda's face clouded. "Sarah went back a few weeks later. She never mentioned the boy again, so I assumed Pastor Jim had handled it."

"Do you know if the boy left the youth group?" Brandon asked.

"I don't know. I didn't follow up as closely as I should have. Sarah seemed okay, and I was dealing with my own grief, trying to keep us afloat financially. I wish—" Her voice broke. "I wish I'd paid more attention."

"Mrs. Carpenter, you did what you could," Matt said gently. "You had no way of knowing."

Brandon pulled out his phone and opened the Facebook photo Matt had found earlier—the 2001 youth group photo with the teenage Marcus Harding. He showed it to Linda.

"Does anyone in this photo look familiar?"

Linda took the phone and squinted at the screen. "That's from Thorndale Community Church. I recognize some of these kids—they're older now, but I can see it. That's the Miller boy, and that's one of the Johnson girls..." Her finger moved across the screen, then stopped. "Him. I think that might have been the boy. The one who made Sarah uncomfortable."

She was pointing at Marcus Harding.

Brandon felt something cold settle in his chest. "Are you certain?"

"Not certain, no. She never told me his name. But that face—there's something familiar about it. And the age is right. He looks about seventeen or eighteen in this photo, which would match the timing."

"Have you heard the name Marcus Harding before?" Brandon asked.

"Harding..." Linda's eyes widened slightly. "Jennifer Harding. I knew a Jennifer Harding years ago. We'd both been widowed young. We talked a few times at church, about losing our husbands, raising kids alone. She had two boys-one around Sarah's age and one older, but I can't remember their names."

"Did Sarah and Jennifer's son know each other?"

"I don't think so. Well, not as friends. They were in the same church, so they probably knew of each other."

Unless the age difference was exactly what attracted Marcus to Sarah. An older teenager, grieving his father, finding a younger girl who was going through the same loss. A connection that felt special. That turned into something darker.

"Mrs. Carpenter," Brandon said carefully, "do you know what happened to Jennifer Harding? Where she is now?"

"She remarried and moved away. I disremember where. That was several years ago, maybe 2005. I haven't kept in touch."

"And her sons?"

"The younger one moved with her. I have no idea about the older boy. He would have been an adult by then and may have alredy been gone."

Matt pulled up the Parke County Sheriff's Office website on his phone. The staff directory page showed three deputies in the right age range:

Deputy Jason Snider, 28
Deputy Miles Kowalski, 29  
Deputy Aaron Bowden, 27

He showed Linda the page. "Have you seen any of these men before?"

Linda looked at each photo carefully. When she got to Miles Kowalski, she paused.

"Him," she said, pointing. "I think I've seen him at the library. He came in a few times earlier this year. Sarah mentioned him once—said he'd asked her about her job, how long she'd worked there, that kind of thing. She thought maybe he was just being friendly."

"Did Sarah seem uncomfortable around him?" Brandon asked.

"Not that she mentioned. But she wouldn't have necessarily told me. Sarah didn't like to worry me."

Matt made a note. "Do you know if Deputy Kowalski knew Sarah from before? From when she was younger?"

"I don't know. I don't remember seeing him back then, but like I said, there were a lot of kids in town that I didn't know well."

Brandon studied the photo of Miles Kowalski on the sheriff's department website. Clean-cut, professional, the kind of face that blended into the background. Nothing remarkable. Nothing threatening.

But the age was right. Twenty-nine in 2011, which meant he was born around 1982. Close enough to the Marcus Harding timeline.

And he'd been asking Sarah about her job. About how long she'd worked there. 

Gathering information. Planning.

"Mrs. Carpenter," Matt said, "when Deputy Kowalski came into the library, did he check out books?"

"I don't know. You'd have to ask Patricia at the library."

Brandon made a note. They'd need to check the library records, see if Miles Kowalski had been a patron. See what kinds of books he was interested in.

"One last question," Brandon said. "Do you know anyone who works in law enforcement? Any family friends, neighbors, anyone Sarah would have trusted?"

Linda shook her head. "Not really. We're pretty quiet. Keep to ourselves. Why?"

"Just being thorough," Matt said.

They stood to leave. Linda walked them to the door, her arms wrapped around herself like she was cold.

"When can I..." she started, then stopped. "When can I bring her home?"

"The state lab needs to complete their examination," Matt said. "But soon. I promise."

Linda nodded. "Thank you. For finding her. For not giving up."

Outside, Matt and Brandon walked to the car in silence. Once they were inside, Matt turned to Brandon.

"So we've got Marcus Harding, age twenty-nine, who lost his father at age ten. Became Dale's stepson at twelve, lived on the property for at least seven years. Was in the same church youth group as Sarah, made her uncomfortable when she was twelve and he was eighteen. Then he disappears from the family photos after the divorce in 2003."

"And Miles Kowalski," Brandon added, "age twenty-nine, matches the physical description from the youth group photo. Came into the library earlier this year asking Sarah questions. Right age, right access, right background."

"If Kowalski is Marcus Harding, he changed his name at some point."

"After the divorce, maybe. Fresh start, new identity. His mother remarried and became Powell—maybe he took that name for a while, then changed it again."

Matt started the car. "We need to find out for certain. Birth records, name change documents, Social Security records. Something that definitively links Miles Kowalski to Marcus Harding."

"And we need to do it quietly," Brandon said. "If Kowalski is our guy and he finds out we're looking at him—"

"Dale's in federal custody. He's safe."

"But we're not. And neither is anyone else who might know the truth."

They sat in Linda Carpenter's driveway, both of them processing the implications.

If Miles Kowalski was Marcus Harding, if he'd been fixated on Sarah since she was eleven years old, if he'd taken her and killed her and investigated his own crime—then they were looking at a cop who'd successfully hidden in plain sight for six months. Who'd had access to every piece of evidence, every witness statement, every lead.

Who was still out there.

Still wearing a badge.

"Back to the station," Matt said. "We need to pull employment records, background checks, anything the department has on Kowalski. And we need to do it without anyone knowing what we're looking for."

Brandon nodded. His mind was already working through the next steps. Birth certificates. Name change petitions. Adoption records if Jennifer had tried to have Dale legally adopt Marcus.

Somewhere in the paper trail, there would be proof.

They just had to find it before Kowalski realized they were looking.
