# Chapter Nine

**Monday Morning**

The federal holding facility was forty minutes north of Indianapolis, tucked between farmland and industrial parks where nobody paid much attention to who came and went. Matt pulled into the visitor lot at nine-fifteen, the morning already bright and cold. Brandon had been quiet during the drive, reviewing the documentation they’d compiled the night before.

Birth certificate for Marcus Robert Harding, born April 3, 1982, in Blackburn, Indiana. Mother: Jennifer Anne Harding. Father: Robert James Harding.

Court petition for legal name change filed in Monroe County, Indiana, December 2004. Marcus Robert Harding to Marcus Robert Powell. Granted January 2005. Even though he was an adult he'd taken his second stepfather's name. His first attempt to run from the boy he'd been.

Second court petition for legal name change filed in Vigo County, Indiana, March 2008. Marcus Robert Powell to Miles Robert Kowalski. Granted April 2008.

Social Security records showing employment history: Miles Robert Kowalski hired by Parke County Sheriff’s Department, August 2009.

“Two name changes,” Matt said as they walked toward the entrance. “First takes his stepfather’s name after the divorce. Then changes completely three years later.”

“Reinvention,” Brandon said. “Or hiding.”

“Both, probably. The second maybe because he didn't want to be associated with his boyhood when he came back home to Parke County."

They checked in at the front desk, showed their credentials, checked their weapons, and were escorted through two sets of security doors to a small conference room. Dale Kovacs sat at a metal table, wearing an orange jumpsuit, hands folded in front of him. He looked tired but calmer than he had on Saturday. Less afraid.

He looked up when they entered. “You found him.”

It wasn’t a question.

Matt sat down across from Dale. Brandon took the chair beside him and pulled out a folder.

“We found evidence of who we believe killed Sarah,” Matt said. “But we need you to confirm it.”

Dale nodded slowly. “Show me.”

Brandon opened the folder and slid a photo across the table. Deputy Miles Kowalski in uniform, official department photo from the sheriff’s website.

Dale stared at the photo for a long moment. His hands trembled slightly.

“That’s him,” Dale said quietly. “That’s Marcus.”

Matt exchanged a glance with Brandon. They’d been ninety percent certain, but hearing Dale confirm it made it real.

“Tell us about Marcus,” Matt said. “Everything. From the beginning.”

Dale took a shaky breath. “I met Jennifer in 1993. She was a widow with two boys—Marcus was eleven, Tyler was three. Their father had died the year before. Cancer. Jennifer was struggling, working two jobs, trying to keep things together. I started helping out. We started dating and eventually got married in June ’94.”

“When did you buy the house?” Brandon asked.

"March ‘94. My parents were getting older, wanted to downsize. They sold me the farm for what I could afford. Jennifer and the boys moved in right after the wedding.” Dale’s expression went distant. “Marcus had a hard time with the transition. New house, new stepfather, still grieving his dad. He’d spend hours in the barn. I fixed up the southeast corner for him—built a little space where he could be alone. Thought it might help him feel like he had something that was his.”

“How was your relationship with him?” Matt asked.

“Complicated. I tried to be a good stepfather. Took him fishing, helped with homework, went to his school events. But he never really warmed to me. Always kept his distance. Polite, but cold.”

“What about with other kids his age?” Brandon asked.

“That was part of the problem. He didn’t connect with kids his own age. The teenagers at church, at school—he didn’t fit in. Too serious, too intense. It got worse as he got older. He was more comfortable around younger kids-Tyler's age.” Dale’s jaw tightened. “I didn’t think much of it at first. Thought he was just immature for his age.”

“When did you realize it was more than that?” Matt asked.

Dale was quiet for a moment. “When he was fifteen. There was a girl at church—Amy something, I can’t remember her last name. She was twelve. Marcus had been paying a lot of attention to her. Walking her to Sunday school, sitting with her at youth group. Her parents thought it was sweet—an older boy looking out for a younger girl. But then Amy told Marcus she didn’t want to hang out with him anymore. That she had a boyfriend her own age.”

“What did Marcus do?” Brandon asked.

“He vandalized her family’s car. Spray-painted horrible things on it. Cruel things.” Dale’s voice shook. “The girl’s parents called the sheriff. But Jennifer and I talked to them, apologized, offered to pay for the damage. We convinced them it was just a stupid teenage prank. That Marcus was going through a hard time, still dealing with his father’s death. They agreed not to involve the police.”

“Did you get Marcus help?” Matt asked. “Counseling, therapy?”

“We tried. Jennifer made him see a counselor for a few months. But Marcus just sat there. Wouldn’t talk. Wouldn’t engage. The counselor said she couldn’t help someone who didn’t want to be helped.” Dale rubbed his face. “I thought maybe he’d grow out of it. That it was just adolescent stupidity.”

“But it wasn’t,” Brandon said.

“No.” Dale looked at the photo of Kowalski again. “About a year later, I noticed Marcus paying attention to another young girl at church. Sarah Carpenter. She’d just lost her father. She was maybe ten or eleven. Marcus was sixteen. He’d talk to her after services, ask her about her dad, how she was coping. At first I thought maybe he was genuinely trying to help—he understood what she was going through.”

“But then it changed,” Matt said.

“I’d catch him watching her. Not just at church, but around town. At the library, at the grocery store. He’d engineer situations to be near her. And Sarah started to seem uncomfortable. She’d avoid him, stay close to her mother. I talked to Jennifer about it. She said I was overreacting. That Marcus was just being kind to a girl who’d lost her father, the way he’d lost his.”

“Did you talk to Marcus directly?” Brandon asked.

“Once. Told him to give Sarah space. That he was making her uncomfortable. He looked at me like I was crazy. Said he was just being friendly. That Sarah was going through what he’d gone through and he wanted to help.” Dale’s hands clenched. “But I saw something in his eyes. Something cold. Like he was daring me to push it further.”

“What happened after that?”

“Things got worse between Jennifer and me. She thought I was being too hard on Marcus. I thought she was enabling him. We fought about it constantly. By 2003, the marriage was over. Jennifer took Tyler and moved to Bloomington. Marcus was twenty-one by then—old enough to be on his own. He left too. Changed his name to Powell, Jennifer’s new married name.”

“Did you stay in touch with him?” Matt asked.

“No. He cut contact completely. I thought that was the end of it. That he was moving on with his life.” Dale’s voice dropped. “Then late last year, I started noticing signs that someone had been in my barn. Tools moved. Things disturbed. It crossed my mind that it might be Marcus. That barn was his space when he was a kid. I think he was coming back to it.”

“Did you confront him?”

“I didn’t know how to find him. He’d changed his name, moved away. And it wasn't a huge concern. I'd only noticed signs he'd been there a couple of times. But then in January, I saw him. At the Rural King in Blackburn. He was in uniform. Deputy sheriff. He didn’t see me, but I recognized him immediately. I'm not sure I would've if I hadn't known him so well. His face had changed a lot as he grew into adulthood. That's when I started stopping by the library, where Sarah worked, more often. I was curious to know if he was watching her.”

“Why not just report it to the sheriff?” Matt asked.

“Because he was the sheriff’s department. And because—” Dale stopped, struggling with the words. “Because part of me still cared about him. He was my stepson for nine years. I raised him. I didn’t want to believe he was dangerous. I thought maybe if I could catch him on camera, I could talk to him. Get him to stop.”

Brandon leaned forward. “Dale, did you know Marcus was fixated on Sarah again?”

Dale’s face crumpled. “I suspected. I did see him at the library a couple times earlier this year. Couldn't tell if he was watching her. I thought about warning her, but what would I say? That my ex-stepson who I hadn’t seen in eight years might be dangerous? Based on what, a feeling?”

“So when you found Sarah in your barn,” Matt said, “you knew immediately it was Marcus.”

“Yes. The blankets, the way she was positioned in that southeast corner—it was his space. He brought her there. Maybe he thought…” Dale’s voice broke. “Maybe he thought he could show her how much she meant to him.”

“Tell us about Marcus’s father,” Brandon said. “Robert Harding.”

“He died when Marcus was ten. Jennifer said Marcus took it hard. Stopped talking for months. Wouldn’t go to school. She had to get him counseling just to function. When I met Marcus two years later, he seemed okay on the surface. But there was something—” Dale searched for the words. “Something frozen about him. Like part of him was still that little boy who’d lost his dad.”

“Disrupted Attachment,” Brandon said quietly.

Matt looked at his partner. Brandon’s expression was carefully neutral, but Matt recognized that look. Brandon was connecting something to his own experience. Maybe to Missouri.

“What do you mean?” Dale asked.

“Sometimes trauma at a critical developmental age can arrest emotional growth,” Brandon explained. “Marcus lost his father at ten. That’s when children are forming their understanding of relationships, attachment, loss. If he never processed that trauma properly, part of him might have remained emotionally ten years old even as he physically aged. He'd have been clingy and controlling in future attachments and prone to rage when rejected.”

“That would explain why he related better to younger children,” Matt added. “Why his fixations were on girls significantly younger than him. He was emotionally closer to their age than to his peers.”

“And when Sarah lost her father at eleven,” Brandon continued, “Marcus saw someone experiencing what he’d experienced. He connected with her in a way he couldn’t connect with girls his own age. But that connection—”

“Turned into obsession,” Dale finished. “Because he couldn’t understand healthy boundaries.”

“Did Marcus have any other violent incidents?” Matt asked. “Besides the vandalism at fifteen?”

“Not that I know of. But after he left, I wasn’t in his life anymore. I don’t know what he did in those years between the divorce and him becoming a deputy.”

Matt made notes. They’d need to check Marcus’s background more thoroughly. College records if he went to college. Work history. Any police reports or complaints.

“Dale,” Brandon said, “when you found Sarah dead in your barn, why didn’t you call 911?”

“Because I knew Marcus was a deputy. I knew he’d have access to everything—the investigation, the evidence, the reports. If I called it in, he’d know. He’d find a way to make it look like I was responsible. I’d kept her in my house for three days. Who would believe I was trying to protect her?”

“So you were more afraid of being blamed than of Marcus himself,” Matt said.

“I was afraid of both. But yes—I knew how it would look. And I knew Marcus was smart enough to use that against me.”

They sat in silence for a moment. Dale stared at the photo of Kowalski, his expression a mix of grief and anger.

“He killed her in my barn,” Dale said quietly. “In the space I built for him. The one place he felt safe as a kid. He turned it into—” His voice broke.

“We’re going to arrest him,” Matt said. “Today. And we’re going to make sure he can’t hurt anyone else.”

Dale looked up, hope and fear mixing in his eyes. “How? You don’t have evidence. It’s just my word against his.”

“We have your statement. We have the connection between Marcus Harding and Miles Kowalski. And we have corroboration from Sarah's mother confirming his childhood fixation-that he'd made her uncomfortable. We have him asking questions at the library earlier this year. It’s circumstantial, but it’s enough to bring him in for questioning.” Matt leaned forward. “And once we start digging into his life, his movements, his background—we’ll find more.”

“What if he lawyers up? What if he doesn’t talk?”

“Then we keep building the case,” Brandon said. “But people like Marcus—people who think they’re smarter than everyone else—they usually want to explain themselves. They want someone to understand why they did what they did.”

“Will you tell Jennifer?” Dale asked. “His mother?”

“Eventually. After the arrest.”

Dale nodded slowly. “She’ll be devastated. She always defended him. Always thought he just needed more understanding, more support. She never saw what he was capable of.”

“Parents rarely do,” Matt said.

They stood to leave. Dale remained seated, still staring at Kowalski’s photo.

"Dale, one last question," Brandon started. "How did you know that Sarah's car had been tampered with? If you weren't the one who took her, how did you know that?"

Dale looked up at them wearily. "He pulled me over on Route 39 in late May, near the Crossroads. Said I was driving erratically. Then he started questioning me about the girl who went missing nearby. Told me I should be careful because police were likely to be suspicious of a man living alone, especially one who drove a dark colored Silverado and had the know-how to tamper with her starter. He remembered that I worked as a mechanic when he was young."

"He was threatening you," Matt said.

"That's how I took it, yes." Dale looked back down at the photo, lines of concern etched across his brow.

Brandon and Matt turned to leave.

“Agent Ellis,” Dale said as they reached the door. “When you arrest him—be careful. Marcus is good at making people underestimate him. He seems calm, reasonable, harmless. But underneath—” He stopped. “Underneath, there’s something broken. Something that never healed.”

“We’ll be careful,” Matt said.

Outside, walking back to the car, Matt turned to Brandon. “Disrupted attachment. That’s what you picked up on in Missouri, isn’t it?”

Brandon didn’t answer immediately. When he did, his voice was quiet. “Trauma changes people. Freezes them in place sometimes. They keep living, keep aging, but part of them stays in that moment. The moment everything broke.”

Matt wanted to ask more, wanted to understand the connection Brandon was making. But Brandon’s expression had closed, the way it always did when Missouri came up.

“Let’s get back to Indianapolis,” Matt said instead. “We need to coordinate with the field office, get a team together for the arrest.”

They drove in silence, both of them thinking about Marcus Harding. About a ten-year-old boy who lost his father. About an fifteen-year-old who vandalized a car because a girl rejected him. About a twenty-nine-year-old deputy sheriff who they believed had strangled a woman in a barn because she didn’t return his feelings.

About all the moments in between where someone could have stopped him.

But didn’t.

**Monday Afternoon**

Miles Kowalski lived in a small rental house on the south edge of Rockville, three blocks from the sheriff’s department. White siding, black shutters, a neat lawn that suggested someone who cared about appearances. His dark green Silverado sat in the driveway.

Matt parked two houses down at two-forty-five PM. Brandon sat in the passenger seat, watching the house. Behind them, in an unmarked sedan, were two agents from the Indianapolis field office—Agent Sarah Chen and Agent David Reeves. Both had been briefed on the situation. Both knew this was a cop they were arresting.

“He’s home,” Brandon said, nodding toward the truck.

Matt checked his phone. Kowalski’s schedule showed he’d worked Sunday overnight, gotten off at seven AM Monday. He should have been sleeping, but lights were on in the house.

“Let’s do this clean,” Matt said into his radio. “Chen and Reeves, you take the back. Gray and I have the front. On my signal.”

Two clicks of acknowledgment.

They got out of the car. Matt could feel his pulse quicken—the familiar pre-arrest adrenaline. Brandon moved beside him, calm and focused. They’d done this dozens of times before, but this one felt different. This was a cop. Someone who’d know the game, know the angles.

They walked up the driveway. Matt positioned himself to the left of the door, Brandon to the right. Matt knocked. Three solid raps.

“Miles Kowalski, FBI. Open the door.”

Movement inside. Footsteps approaching. The door opened.

Miles Kowalski stood there in sweatpants and a t-shirt, barefoot, hair slightly disheveled from sleep. He looked younger than his photo—boyish, almost. His expression was curious but not alarmed.

“Can I help you?” His voice was calm, polite.

Matt held up his badge. “FBI, Mr. Kowalski. We have a warrant for your arrest.”

Something flickered in Kowalski’s eyes—surprise, then calculation. But his expression remained neutral. “What’s this about?”

“The murder of Sarah Carpenter,” Brandon said.

Kowalski’s face went very still. For a moment, Matt thought he might run. But then Kowalski’s shoulders relaxed slightly, and he smiled. Not a nervous smile. A confident one.

“I think there’s been a mistake,” Kowalski said. “I investigated Sarah’s disappearance. I didn’t have anything to do with her death.”

“We can discuss that back at our office,” Matt said. “Turn around, hands behind your back.”

Kowalski didn’t move. “Do I need to call my union rep?”

“You can call whoever you want once we get to Indianapolis. Turn around.”

Kowalski held Matt’s gaze for a long moment. Then he sighed, like this was all a minor inconvenience, and turned around. “This is going to be embarrassing when you realize you’ve got the wrong guy.”

Matt cuffed him while Brandon cleared the doorway. Chen and Reeves appeared from the back, confirming the house was secure.

“We also have a warrant to search the premises,” Matt said. “Agent Chen and Agent Reeves will execute it while we transport you.”

“Search warrant?” Kowalski’s tone was mildly amused. “For what?”

“Evidence related to Sarah Carpenter’s murder.”

“You won’t find anything,” Kowalski said. “Because there’s nothing to find.”

Matt walked him to the car, one hand on Kowalski’s elbow. Brandon followed, scanning the street for observers. A neighbor two houses down had come out to her porch, watching. Word would spread fast in a small town.

They put Kowalski in the back seat. Matt got behind the wheel, Brandon in the passenger seat. As they pulled away, Matt glanced in the rearview mirror. Kowalski sat calmly, looking out the window like he was being driven to a dental appointment, not an interrogation.

“You guys are making a big mistake,” Kowalski said after a few minutes. “I’m a cop. I worked Sarah’s case. You really think I’d investigate my own crime?”

“It’s been done before,” Brandon said without turning around.

“Not by me.” Kowalski leaned back against the seat. “Dale Kovacs is lying to you. Whatever he told you, it’s bullshit. He’s trying to save himself.”

“We haven’t mentioned Dale Kovacs,” Matt said.

Kowalski’s smile faltered for just a second. “He’s the guy you arrested, right? I was there, remember. You found Sarah’s body on his land. Chain in his bedroom. Pretty obvious he’s your guy.”

“Then why are we arresting you?” Brandon asked.

“Because he lied. Told you some story about someone else being responsible. And you believed him.” Kowalski’s voice was calm, reasonable. “Look, I get it. You want to solve this case. You want to give Sarah’s family closure. But you’re barking up the wrong tree.”

Matt didn’t respond. Let Kowalski talk. People who thought they were smart always talked too much.

“I knew Sarah,” Kowalski continued. “She worked at the library. I’d go in there sometimes, check out books. We’d chat. Small talk. That’s it. Nothing weird, nothing inappropriate. Just two people being friendly in a small town.”

“When did you start going to the library?” Brandon asked.

“I don’t know. Earlier this year? February maybe?”

“Why that library? Don’t you live in Rockville?”

“Blackburn’s library is nicer. Best selection in the county.” Kowalski shifted in his seat. “Look, I’m cooperating here. Answering your questions. But I’m going to need to talk to a lawyer before we go much further.”

“That’s your right,” Matt said.

They drove the rest of the way in silence. Kowalski stared out the window, his expression unreadable. But Matt could see the wheels turning behind his eyes. Calculating. Planning.

By the time they reached the Indianapolis FBI office at four-thirty, the sun was getting low in the sky. They brought Kowalski in through the secure entrance, processed him, and placed him in Interview Room Two.

Matt and Brandon watched him through the one-way glass. Kowalski sat at the table, hands cuffed in front of him now, looking around the room with mild interest. Not nervous. Not agitated. Just waiting.

“He thinks he can talk his way out of this,” Brandon said.

“Can he?”

“Not if we do this right.”

Matt’s phone buzzed. A text from Chen: *Found something. Box in closet. Photos, newspaper clippings, church youth group bulletin fro 1998-when he was a kid. All related to Sarah.*

Matt showed the message to Brandon. “Youthful fixation.”

“Enough to show pattern of behavior. Not enough to prove murder.”

“We don’t need to prove murder in the interview. We just need to get him talking. Get him to make a mistake.”

Brandon stared through the glass at Kowalski. “He’s not going to break easily.”

“No. People like him usually do eventually—they want to be understood.”

Matt’s phone rang. Dunham.

“Chief Deputy,” Matt answered.

“Ellis. I heard you arrested Kowalski.” Dunham’s voice was tight, controlled. “Please tell me you have a good reason.”

“We do. We’re about to start the interview. Can you get up here?”

“I’m already on my way. Be there in thirty minutes.” Dunham paused. “I’ve known Miles for over two years. Worked with him every day. This better not be a mistake.”

“It’s not.”

After Dunham hung up, Matt turned to Brandon. “We should wait for Dunham. Brief him first, then go in.”

Brandon nodded, still watching Kowalski through the glass.

Miles Kowalski sat patiently, waiting to explain why they were wrong.

Waiting to convince them he was innocent.

But in that box in his closet, surrounded by photos of a girl who’d died in a barn, the truth was already speaking louder than any words he could say.
