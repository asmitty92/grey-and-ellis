# Chapter Ten
**Monday Evening**

Brandon stood in front of the one-way glass, watching Miles Kowalski sit motionless at the metal table in Interview Room Two. The observation room was small and dark, just enough space for three people to stand comfortably. Matt was on the phone with the Indianapolis field office supervisor, giving an update. Brandon tuned him out.

Kowalski's hands rested flat on the table, palms down. His posture was relaxed—shoulders back, spine straight but not rigid. He'd been sitting like that for twenty minutes, barely moving except to blink. Most people in an interrogation room fidgeted. Tapped fingers. Shifted weight. Checked the clock on the wall. Kowalski just sat.

But there were tells if you knew where to look.

His right index finger moved in small circles against the table surface. Unconscious. A self-soothing gesture. And every thirty seconds or so, his eyes would flick to the mirror—not obviously, just a quick glance—checking to see if anyone was watching.

Someone who thought he was in control. Someone who'd practiced being calm under pressure. Maybe had practiced it in front of a mirror.

Someone who was working very hard to appear like he had nothing to hide.

Brandon had seen that before. The ones who were truly innocent looked different. They were confused, frustrated, sometimes angry. They wanted to know why they were there, what the hell was going on. They didn't sit perfectly still with practiced calm.

The people who sat like Kowalski were the ones who'd been preparing for this moment. Who'd thought through what they'd say, how they'd act, what mask they'd wear.

The door behind Brandon opened. Chief Deputy Dunham walked in, his face drawn and tired. He'd made the drive from Rockville in under forty minutes.

Matt ended his call and turned. "Tom."

Dunham nodded to both of them, then looked through the glass at Kowalski. "I need to hear it. All of it. Why you think one of my deputies murdered Sarah Carpenter."

Matt pulled out a folder and opened it on the small desk beneath the window. "His real name is Marcus Robert Harding. He's Dale Kovacs's former stepson. He lived on that property from age twelve to twenty-one. According to Kovacs, he spent a lot of time in the barn where we found the bracelet."

Dunham stared at the documents. Birth certificate. Name change petitions. Employment records.

"He developed a fixation on Sarah when she was eleven and he was seventeen," Brandon said quietly. "Both had lost their fathers. He saw it as a connection. But Sarah felt uncomfortable around him. Her mother confirmed it."

"That was over ten years ago," Dunham said. "Kids are weird. They grow out of things."

"Some do," Brandon said. "Marcus didn't. We found a box in his closet. Photos of Sarah. Newspaper clippings about her disappearance. A church bulletin from 1998 when they were both in youth group together. He's been holding onto this for over a decade."

Dunham was quiet for a long moment, staring through the glass. "I hired him two years ago. Did a full background check. Nothing came up."

"As far as we can tell, he doesn't have a record," Matt said. "Plus he's been through two name changes. His record is clean. But we have a statement that he lashed out at least once before when a girl rejected him. And the girl's family will be able to corroborate that."

"Jesus." Dunham rubbed his face. "I worked with him almost every day. How did I not see it?"

"Because he's good at hiding," Brandon said. "He's had years of practice."

Through the glass, Kowalski shifted slightly in his chair. His eyes went to the mirror again. Longer this time. Like he knew they were talking about him.

"What's your plan for the interview?" Dunham asked.

"We present the evidence," Matt said. "Show him we know who he really is. Give him the opportunity to explain."

"You think he'll talk without a lawyer?"

"I think his ego won't let him stay quiet," Brandon said. "He thinks he's smarter than us. He'll want to prove it."

Dunham looked at Brandon, then at Matt. "You're sure about this. Because if you're wrong—"

"We're not wrong," Matt said.

Dunham exhaled slowly. "All right. I'll watch from here. But Ellis—if this goes sideways, it's on you."

"Understood."

Matt gathered the folder and looked at Brandon. "Ready?"

Brandon nodded. But he took one more moment to study Kowalski through the glass.

Twenty-nine years old. Deputy sheriff. Clean record. Friendly face. The kind of person who'd blend into a small town, who'd be trusted, who'd be above suspicion.

But Brandon could tell that friendly face was a well-rehearsed mask. Underneath lurked something frozen and broken. A ten-year-old boy who'd never fully processed his father's death. Who'd found another grieving child and mistaken her pain for connection. Who'd built that connection into something twisted and possessive over thirteen years.

And when that fantasy finally shattered—when Sarah rejected him again, when Dale took her away from him, when she asked him "why"—that broken thing inside him had lashed out.

Brandon pulled his attention back to the present. Took a breath. Centered himself.

Then he and Matt walked out of the observation room and down the short hallway to Interview Room Two.

---

The door opened and Marcus Kowalski looked up. His expression shifted to mild curiosity, like they were colleagues meeting for coffee instead of an interrogation.

"Agents," he said. "Long wait. Was starting to think you'd forgotten about me."

Matt closed the door and sat down across from Kowalski. Brandon took the chair beside Matt, setting a folder on the table between them.

"Mr. Kowalski," Matt started, "before we begin, I need to inform you of your rights. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand these rights?"

"I do," Kowalski said.

"Do you wish to have an attorney present?"

Kowalski smiled. Not nervous. Confident. "I don't think that's necessary. I didn't do anything wrong. I'm happy to answer your questions."

Matt slid a form across the table. "P sign this Miranda waiver stating you are waiving your right to an attorney at this time."

Kowalski picked up the pen Matt handed him and scribbled his signature with one fluid stroke. He handed the pen back and placed his hands flat on the table again.

Brandon watched Kowalski's hands. Flat on the table. His index finger resumed making those small circles. The self-soothing gesture hadn't stopped.

"Good," Matt said. "Then let's start with something simple. How long have you lived in Rockville?"

"About two and a half years. I moved there in early 2009 when I got hired by the sheriff's department."

"And before that?"

"Bloomington. I was going to school at IU."

"What did you study?"

"Criminal justice. Graduated in 2008."

Matt nodded, writing. "And before Bloomington?"

Kowalski hesitated. Just a fraction of a second. "I moved around a bit. Lived in Terre Haute for a while."

"What about when you were younger? Where did you grow up?"

"Different places," Kowalski said. His tone was still casual, but Brandon saw the shift in his posture. Shoulders tensing slightly. "My mom moved a few times after my dad died."

"Your father," Matt said. "Robert Harding."

Kowalski went very still. "How do you know my father's name?"

"Because we know who you are, Marcus."

The air in the room changed. Kowalski's expression didn't shift much—just a slight tightening around his eyes—but Brandon felt it. A slight crack appeared in his mask.

"I don't know what you're talking about," Kowalski said.

Brandon spoke for the first time since entering the room. His voice was quiet, gentle. "Your father died when you were ten. Cancer. That must have been devastating."

Kowalski looked at him. "A lot of kids lose parents. It doesn't make them murderers."

"We're not saying it does," Brandon said. "But it changes you. Leaves a...a mark. Trauma always does. Makes it hard to form attachments later. Leaves you Feeling frozen in time. Like you were stuck being that ten-year-old boy even as you got older."

Something flickered across Kowalski's face. Recognition, maybe. Or surprise that someone understood.

"I got therapy," Kowalski said. "I dealt with it."

"Did you?" Brandon asked. "Because two years after your father died, your mother married Dale Kovacs. And you moved to a farm on County Road 275. That must have been hard. New stepfather. New house. Still grieving."

"Dale was fine," Kowalski said. His voice had gone flat. "He tried. But he wasn't my dad."

"No," Brandon agreed. "He wasn't. But he gave you space. Built you a place in the barn where you could be alone. That southeast corner. That was yours."

Kowalski's breathing had changed. Faster. Shallower.

"How do you know about that?" he asked.

Matt opened the folder. "Because we've talked to Dale. And he told us everything, Marcus."

"Stop calling me that," Kowalski said. "My name is Miles."

"Is it?" Matt slid a document across the table. "Because according to Monroe County records, you legally changed your name from Marcus Robert Harding to Marcus Robert Powell in January 2005. Then three years later, in Vigo County, you changed it again. Marcus Robert Powell to Miles Robert Kowalski."

Kowalski stared at the documents. "People change their names. It's not illegal."

"No, it's not," Matt said. "But it's interesting. Why did you change your name twice?"

"Fresh start," Kowalski said. "After the divorce, my mom remarried. I took her new husband's name. Then later I wanted something completely different."

"Or you wanted to hide," Brandon said. "You wanted to come back to Parke County without anyone recognizing you. Without anyone connecting you to the boy who used to live on Dale Kovacs's farm."

"I'm not hiding anything."

Matt slid another document across the table. "This is a statement from Linda Carpenter. Sarah's mother. She remembers you from church. Says you paid a lot of attention to Sarah when she was eleven years old. Right after HER father died. Made her uncomfortable enough that she asked to skip youth group for a while."

Kowalski's jaw tightened. "I was trying to help her. She was going through what I went through. I thought I could—" He stopped himself.

"You thought you could what?" Brandon asked gently.

"Nothing. I was seventeen. I was trying to be nice to a kid who'd lost her dad. That's it."

"But it wasn't just being nice, was it?" Brandon said. "You felt a connection to her. Someone who understood what you'd been through. Who knew what it was like to lose a parent that young."

Kowalski didn't respond.

Matt pulled out another photo. The box from Kowalski's closet. Photos of Sarah spread out on a table.

"We found this in your house," Matt said. "Photos of Sarah Carpenter. Newspaper clippings about her disappearance. A church bulletin from 1998 with both your names circled. You've been holding onto this for twelve years, Marcus."

"Stop calling me that," Kowalski said again. His voice was strained now.

"Why did you keep these?" Brandon asked.

"I don't know. I just—" Kowalski looked at the photos. "She mattered to me. When we were kids. I thought about her sometimes. Wondered how she was doing. That's not a crime."

"No," Matt said. "But murder is."

"I didn't murder anyone." Kowalski's voice rose slightly. "Dale is lying to you. He's the one who had Sarah in his house. He's the one who buried her body. And you're believing him over me because of some old photos?"

"We also have a witness," Matt said. "Who saw a dark-colored Silverado at the Crossroads Mini-Mart the night Sarah disappeared. It had a decal on the back window. You drive a dark green Silverado with a Browning decal on the back window."

"So do half the guys in this county."

"But most of them didn't know Sarah," Brandon said. "Most of them didn't have a childhood obsession with her. Most of them didn't change their name twice and come back to Parke County to work as a deputy sheriff in the same town where she lived."

Kowalski was breathing hard now. The crack growing wider.

"You started going to the library earlier this year," Matt said. "February, you told us in the car. The librarian remembers you. Says you asked Sarah questions about her job. About her schedule. You were gathering information."

"I was being friendly," Kowalski said. His hands formed fists on the table. "That's what people do in small towns. They talk to each other. It doesn't prove anything."

"About six months before Sarah was murdered, Dale noticed someone had been coming on his land, spending time in his barn. We think it was you," Brandon said quietly. "We think you'd been visiting that barn. Maybe because it reminded you of when you were younger. When things were simpler. Before Dale and your mother divorced. Before everything fell apart."

"You don't know what you're talking about."

"We think you were in Blackburn while you were on duty on April 16th. Saw Sarah's car at the library that day," Brandon continued. "Maybe you'd been watching her, waiting for an opportunity. And you sabotaged it. Loosened the connection to the starter so it wouldn't catch right. So she'd be stranded."

"That's insane."

"You knew she'd stop at the Crossroads," Matt said. "If you'd been watching her. She always got gas there on her way home from her Thursday shift. So you waited. And when her car wouldn't start, when she was alone at that payphone—you approached her."

Kowalski shook his head. "No. That's not—I didn't—"

"She knew you," Brandon said. "Recognized the friendly deputy sheriff who sometimes stopped by the library. You told her you were there to help. That you could help her with her car."

"Stop," Kowalski said.

"She wasn't afraid at first. Not until you grabbed her and pulled her into your truck."

"I said stop!"

Matt leaned forward. "Where did you take her, Marcus? To Dale's barn? Your old hideout?"

Kowalski's breathing was ragged now. His composure crumbling. "I didn't hurt her. I was trying to protect her."

"Protect her from what?" Brandon asked.

"From Dale!" Kowalski's voice cracked. "He was watching her. Following her. I saw him at the library all the time. I knew what he was doing. He's sick. He always was. And I couldn't let him—I had to—"

He stopped. Realized what he'd said. His face went pale.

"You took her to the barn," Brandon said gently. "To protect her from Dale."

Kowalski didn't respond. His hands were shaking.

"You were the first officer on scene after the call came in about Sarah," Brandon continued. "You must have drugged her to make sure she wouldn't get away. Did you take her to Dale's barn before you responded to the scene or after?"

Kowalski's eyes filled with tears.

"Dale found her," Matt said. "Broke the chain. Kept her in his house for three days. You must have realized that when you went back the next night and she wasn't in the barn where you'd left her."

"When he finally left on the third day, you went back for her," Brandon said. "Took her to your barn. To save her from Dale."

Kowalski wiped his eyes. "She was supposed to understand. I explained it to her. Told her Dale was dangerous. That I'd been watching him. That I was there to protect her. But she wouldn't listen. She kept asking to go home. Kept saying I was scaring her."

"What happened in the barn, Marcus?" Brandon asked quietly.

Kowalski's face crumpled. "I just wanted to talk to her. To make her understand. But she kept pulling away. Kept trying to scream. I just needed her to be quiet. To listen."

Brandon could feel it now. The impression from that barn. The terror. The desperate need to make someone understand. The hands closing around a throat. The moment everything went wrong.

"She asked you why," Brandon said. His voice was barely above a whisper.

Kowalski looked up sharply.

"Not 'why are you doing this,'" Brandon continued. "Just 'why.' One word. That's all she said before you put your hands on her throat."

The color drained from Kowalski's face. His mouth opened but no sound came out.

"How did you know that?" he whispered.

Brandon didn't answer. He just held Kowalski's gaze.

"How did you know that?" Kowalski said again, louder now. "No one—Dale wasn't there—no one could have—"

The room went silent.

Brandon could feel Matt's incredulous gaze boring a hole in him. And through the one-way glass, Dunham was watching. Both of them trying to understand what had just happened.

But Brandon kept his eyes on Marcus Kowalski as the man across from him began to shake, his carefully constructed mask finally, completely shattered.
