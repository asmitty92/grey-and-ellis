# Chapter Eleven
**Monday Evening**

Matt had been taking notes when Brandon said it. He'd been writing down the timeline—Marcus taking Sarah to the barn, drugging her, Dale finding her—when his partner's voice went quiet and said something that made no sense.

"She asked you why. Not 'why are you doing this.' Just 'why.' One word. That's all she said before you put your hands on her throat."

Matt's pen stopped moving.

That wasn't in Dale's statement. Dale hadn't been there for the murder. He'd found Sarah's body after. There was no way Brandon could know what Sarah had said in her final moments.

Unless—

Matt looked up from his notes. Kowalski had gone completely white. His mouth hung open, no sound coming out.

"How did you know that?" Kowalski whispered.

Brandon didn't answer. He just held Kowalski's gaze with that same quiet intensity he'd had throughout the interview.

"How did you know that?" Kowalski said again, his voice rising. "No one—Dale wasn't there—no one could have—"

Matt's mind raced. Brandon had said something he couldn't possibly know. Something specific enough that Kowalski recognized it as true. Which meant either Brandon had guessed—impossibly lucky—or...

Or Brandon really did see things. Know things. In ways Matt had never fully understood.

Matt had worked with Brandon for three years. He'd watched his partner stand at crime scenes and reconstruct events with uncanny accuracy. He'd heard Brandon describe victim psychology, perpetrator motivation, timelines and sequences that later proved correct. Matt had always assumed it was just exceptional observational skills. Pattern recognition. Experience.

But this wasn't observation. This was knowledge. Specific, impossible knowledge.

Kowalski's hands were shaking on the table. His breathing had gone ragged. The mask he'd practiced so arduously—the calm, confident deputy—had shattered completely.

Brandon leaned forward slightly. His voice was still gentle, almost compassionate.

"You told her you loved her," Brandon said. "You said it three times while your hands were around her neck. You needed her to know."

Kowalski made a sound—half sob, half gasp. "Stop. Please stop."

"She couldn't breathe," Brandon continued. "But she heard you. In those last moments, she heard you saying you loved her."

"How?" Kowalski's voice broke. "How do you know these things?"

Matt wanted to ask the same question. He wanted to stop the interview, pull Brandon aside, demand an explanation. But he couldn't. Not now. Not when Kowalski was breaking.

"It doesn't matter how," Brandon said quietly. "What matters is what happened. And why."

Kowalski put his head in his hands. His shoulders shook. When he looked up, tears streamed down his face.

"I loved her," he said. "I loved her since we were kids. Since I saw her at church after her dad died. She understood. She was the only one who understood what it felt like."

"You were both grieving," Brandon said.

"Yes." Kowalski wiped his eyes. "Everyone else—they didn't get it. They'd say stupid things like 'he's in a better place' or 'time heals all wounds.' But Sarah—she knew. She knew what it was like to have that hole inside you that nothing could fill."

"So you connected with her," Matt said, finding his voice.

"I tried to help her. I'd talk to her at church, at youth group. Tell her it was okay to be sad. That she didn't have to pretend everything was fine." Kowalski's voice was desperate now, pleading. "I was trying to be there for her. The way I wished someone had been there for me."

"But she pulled away," Brandon said.

"Her mother." Kowalski's expression hardened. "Linda. She told Sarah I was too old to be hanging around her. That it wasn't appropriate. She turned Sarah against me."

"Sarah was eleven," Matt said. "You were seventeen."

"That didn't matter!" Kowalski's voice rose. "Age is just a number. What mattered was that we understood each other. That we had this connection. But they took that away from me."

Matt made notes, keeping his expression neutral. The delusion was complete. Kowalski genuinely believed a seventeen-year-old's fixation on an eleven-year-old was appropriate. That a child's grief created some kind of romantic bond.

"So you left," Brandon said. "After Dale and your mother divorced."

"I had to. Dale made it clear I wasn't welcome. He knew about Sarah. Thought there was something wrong with me. And my mom—she always took his side." Kowalski wiped his face again. "I changed my name. Started over. Went to college. Tried to move on."

"But you couldn't," Matt said.

"I thought about her all the time. Wondered how she was doing. If she was okay. If she still thought about me." Kowalski looked at the photos spread on the table. "When I graduated from the police academy, I knew I wanted to come back. To make sure she was safe."

"Safe from what?" Brandon asked.

"From people who'd want to hurt her. She was so fragile after she lost her dad." Kowalski's jaw tightened. "I became a cop so I could protect her. So I could watch over her without anyone questioning it."

Matt felt something cold settle in his chest. Kowalski had planned this for years. Changed his name, became a police officer, got hired in Parke County—all so he could be near Sarah without being recognized as the teenager who'd made her uncomfortable.

"And when you saw Dale at the library," Brandon said, "you thought he was a threat."

"I knew what he was capable of. I grew up with him. He had this way of watching people. Studying them. And when I saw him at the library, saw him watching Sarah—" Kowalski shook his head. "I knew I had to do something."

Matt knew they could explain to him that Dale was only at the library so much because he was concerned that Kowalski still had an unhealthy interest in Sarah, but it wouldn't change how he felt about it. This 29 year old man in front of them was still processing the situation like an adolescent. 

"So you took her," Matt said.

"I saved her." Kowalski's voice was firm. "I saw her car at the library that day. I was on patrol in Blackburn. I knew she'd be finishing her shift soon. So I made sure her car adolescentwouldn't start. Made sure she'd be stranded."

"And you waited at the Crossroads," Brandon said.

"I knew she'd stop there. She always did on Thursdays. I parked where I could see the payphone, where I could watch." Kowalski's expression softened. "She looked so scared when her car wouldn't start. I just wanted to help her. To let her know everything would be okay."

"But you drugged her," Matt said.

"I had to. She was panicking. I told her I was there to help, that I'd take her somewhere safe. But she wouldn't calm down. She kept asking questions. So I gave her something to help her relax."

"Rohypnol?" Matt asked.

Kowalski nodded. "Just enough to keep her calm. I didn't want to hurt her."

"Where did you take her?"

"To Dale's barn. My old space. The corner he'd built for me." Kowalski's voice went distant. "I thought—I thought if I could just talk to her there, in a place that meant something to me, she'd understand. She'd see that I was trying to protect her."

"But Dale found her," Brandon said.

"I had to respond to the call about her disappearance. I couldn't—I couldn't stay with her." Kowalski's hands clenched. "When I went back the next night, she was gone. Dale had taken her. Put her in his house. Locked her up like an animal."

"So you waited," Matt said. "Waited for Dale to leave."

"Three days. Three days watching his property. Waiting for my chance." Kowalski's voice shook. "When he finally left on Friday, I broke in. Found her in that bedroom. She was so scared. So confused. I tried to explain that Dale was dangerous, that I'd saved her from him. But she wouldn't listen."

"You took her back to the barn," Brandon said quietly.

"I had to. Dale would be back. I needed somewhere we could talk without being interrupted." Kowalski looked at his hands. "I thought—I thought if I could just make her understand—"

"But she didn't understand," Matt said.

"She kept asking to go home. Kept saying she wanted her mother. I tried to explain that I loved her. That I'd always loved her. That everything I'd done was to keep her safe." Kowalski's voice cracked. "But she looked at me like I was a monster."

The room was quiet for a moment. Matt could hear the hum of the fluorescent lights overhead, the distant sound of voices in the hallway outside.

"What happened then?" Brandon asked. His voice was so gentle it was almost a whisper.

Kowalski's face crumpled. "She tried to scream. I couldn't—I couldn't let her scream. Someone might hear. So I put my hands on her throat. Just to quiet her. Just until she calmed down."

"But she didn't calm down," Matt said.

"She fought. Clawed at the ground. At my hands. I kept telling her it was okay. That I loved her. That everything would be okay if she just stopped fighting." Kowalski was crying now, tears streaming down his face. "I said it three times. 'I love you. I love you. I love you.' I needed her to know. I needed her to understand before—"

He stopped. His whole body shaking.

"Before she died," Brandon finished.

Kowalski nodded, sobbing. "I didn't mean to. I just wanted her to be quiet. To listen. But she kept fighting and then—then she stopped. And I realized—" His voice broke completely. "I realized what I'd done."

Matt set down his pen. They had it. A full confession. On tape. Witnessed by Dunham through the glass.

"What did you do with her body?" Matt asked.

"I left her there. In the barn. In my corner. I couldn't—I couldn't move her. Couldn't touch her." Kowalski wiped his eyes. "I went home. Tried to figure out what to do. I expected there to be a call the next day. I expected Dale to report finding her body."

"Except he didn't report it," Brandon said.

"No. He buried her. The coward buried her." Kowalski's expression hardened. "He knew if they found her on his land, after he'd kept her in his house, they'd blame him. So he buried her and kept quiet."

"And you let him," Matt said. "You knew where Sarah was. You knew what had happened to her. But you kept investigating the case. Kept interviewing witnesses. Kept pretending you didn't know."

"I had to. If I'd said anything, they'd know I was involved." Kowalski looked between them. "You have to understand. I didn't want to hurt her. I loved her. I was trying to protect her."

"From Dale," Brandon said.

"Yes. From Dale. But really from anyone who'd want to hurt her." Kowalski's voice was pleading now. "She was supposed to understand. We were supposed to be together. It wasn't supposed to end like this."

Matt closed his notebook. "I think that's all we need. You'll be transported to a holding facility pending arraignment."

Kowalski didn't resist. He just sat there, tears still streaming down his face, broken and defeated.

"I loved her," he said again, quietly. "I just wanted her to know."

---

They left Kowalski in the interview room with two agents guarding the door. Matt and Brandon walked down the hallway in silence. Dunham met them outside the observation room, his face pale.

"Jesus Christ," Dunham said. "I worked with him for two years. Rode in a car with him. Had coffee with him. And I never—" He stopped, shaking his head.

"He's good at hiding," Matt said. "He's had years of practice."

"The things he said. The way he justified it." Dunham looked back toward the interview room. "He really believes he loved her. That he was protecting her."

"People like Marcus build narratives that let them live with themselves," Brandon said. "He's been telling himself this story for thirteen years. That he and Sarah had a special connection. That everyone else was wrong. That he was the hero."

"Will the confession hold up in court?" Dunham asked.

"He was Mirandized. He waived his right to counsel in writing. The confession was voluntary." Matt felt the weight of the day settling on him. "It'll hold."

Dunham nodded slowly. "I'll coordinate with the prosecutor's office. Start the paperwork." He paused. "Good work. Both of you. I don't know how you broke him, but—good work."

After Dunham left, Matt turned to Brandon. His partner stood with his arms crossed, staring at nothing.

"Gray," Matt said quietly.

Brandon looked at him.

"We need to talk."

---

They found an empty conference room on the second floor. Matt closed the door and leaned against it. Brandon sat at the table, his expression carefully neutral.

"How did you know?" Matt asked.

"Know what?"

"Don't." Matt's voice was firm. "Don't pretend you don't know what I'm asking. You said things in that interview that you couldn't possibly know. Specific things. About what Sarah said. About what Marcus said. Things that weren't in any report or witness statement."

Brandon was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was measured. "Sometimes at crime scenes, I get impressions. Images. Like echoes of what happened there."

"Impressions."

"I don't know what else to call it." Brandon looked at his hands. "It's not like I hear voices or see ghosts. It's more like—like my brain processes the physical evidence and the psychological context and creates a reconstruction. But it feels more vivid than just theory. More certain."

"You saw what happened in that barn," Matt said.

"I felt it. Both times we were there. The fear. The desperation. The moment Sarah realized she wasn't going to survive." Brandon's jaw tightened. "And I felt Marcus too. The need to make her understand. The love twisted up with control. The moment it all went wrong."

Matt sat down across from his partner. "How long have you been able to do this?"

"Since I was ten."

"Missouri," Matt said.

Brandon nodded slowly. "The case I told you about. A woman taken from a phone booth. I went to that scene. I saw—" He stopped, his expression closing. "That's when it started. The impressions. The knowing things I shouldn't know. It's like the trauma experienced at these scenes leaves an mark that I can find."

"The boyfriend," Matt said, remembering Brandon's reaction when they'd talked about the Ashford case. The anger when Matt had suggested the boyfriend might be involved. "You said he was beyond reproach."

Brandon looked up, and Matt saw something in his eyes—pain, old and deep.

"He was my brother, Tom," Brandon said quietly. "The woman who was taken—she was his girlfriend. His fiance really, but he hadn't bought her a ring yet. He was on the phone with her when it happened. Heard the whole thing. Tried to get there in time but couldn't."

Matt felt like the air had been punched out of his lungs. "Jesus, Gray."

"That case was never solved. Early on, the town rumor mill thought Tom might have had something to do with it. My brother spent years trying to find answers. Trying to find her. It destroyed him." Brandon's voice was flat, carefully controlled. "And I was ten years old, trying to understand what had happened. Trying to make sense of it. I visited the scene multiple times, and that's when I started seeing things. Knowing things. Like some part of me broke open that day and never closed."

"Is it real?" Matt asked. "Or is it just—"

"I don't know." Brandon looked at him directly. "I've asked myself that for over twenty years. Is it some kind of ability? Or am I just very good at reading evidence and my brain presents it as certainty? I honestly don't know, Matt. But it works. It helps me solve cases. So I use it."

Matt thought about the past three years. All the times Brandon had reconstructed crime scenes with uncanny accuracy. All the times he'd described victim psychology or perpetrator motivation that later proved correct. Matt had assumed it was skill and experience.

It was those things, but now he knew it was also something else. Something inexplicable.

"Does it always work?" Matt asked.

"No. Sometimes I don't get anything-maybe the trauma response isn't strong enough. Sometimes the impressions are vague, unclear. And sometimes—" Brandon paused. "Sometimes I'm wrong. I try to verify everything I can. I don't make accusations based solely on impressions. But in interviews, when I need to break someone—"

"You use it," Matt finished.

"Yes."

They sat in silence for a moment. Matt's mind was still trying to process what he'd just learned. That his partner had some kind of inexplicable ability. That Brandon had been carrying this since he was ten years old. That the Missouri case had been personal in ways Matt had never understood.

"The things you said in there," Matt said. "About Sarah asking 'why.' About Marcus saying 'I love you' three times. You knew those things. Kowalski's reaction proved it."

"Yes."

"How?"

"I don't know, Matt. I stood in that barn and I felt what happened there."

Matt leaned back in his chair. "This is going to sound crazy, but—do you think you're psychic?"

"I don't believe in psychics," Brandon said. "I think there's probably a rational explanation. Maybe I'm picking up on micro-expressions, body language, environmental cues that my conscious mind doesn't register but my subconscious processes. Maybe I'm just very good at reading crime scenes and my brain can fill in the gaps."

"But you don't know for sure."

"No. I don't know for sure." Brandon met his eyes. "Does it matter?"

Matt thought about that. Did it matter if Brandon's ability was supernatural or just an exceptional skill? The results were the same. Cases got solved. Killers got caught. Justice was served.

But it did matter. Because if Brandon really could see things that happened at crime scenes, really could know details he had no way of knowing—that changed everything.

"Yeah," Matt said finally. "It matters. Because I need to know if what you're telling me in investigations is based on evidence or on something I can't verify. I need to know if I can trust—" He stopped.

"If you can trust me," Brandon finished. His voice was quiet. "That's what you're really asking."

"I do trust you, Gray. You're my partner. But this—" Matt gestured helplessly. "This is a lot."

"I know." Brandon stood. "I've never told anyone before. About the impressions. About how I work cases. I just let people assume I'm good at my job. Which I am. But there's—there's something else too. And I don't understand it any better than you do."

Matt stood as well. "The confession will hold. We have enough physical evidence to corroborate it—the box in his closet, the name changes, witness statements. We don't need—we don't need whatever this is."

"I know."

"But Jesus, Gray. You should have told me. Three years working together and you never—"

"I was afraid," Brandon said. His voice was barely audible. "Afraid you'd think I was crazy. Afraid you wouldn't want to work with me anymore. Afraid—" He stopped.

Matt understood. Brandon had been carrying this alone since he was ten years old. This thing he couldn't explain, couldn't prove, could barely articulate. And he'd been afraid that if anyone knew, they'd see him as broken. As unreliable. It wasn't that different from the trauma that Marcus Harding had carried.

"I don't think you're crazy," Matt said. "I think—I think you have something I don't understand. But I've seen it work. I've seen you solve cases that should have been unsolvable. So whatever this is—" He paused. "We'll figure it out. Together."

Brandon nodded, relief visible in his expression.

"But Gray," Matt added, his voice firm. "No more secrets. If there's something else I need to know—about you, about how you work, about anything—you tell me. We're partners. That means we trust each other with everything."

"Okay," Brandon said. "No more secrets."

They stood there for a moment, the weight of the confession and the revelation hanging between them.

"We should get back," Matt said finally. "Finish processing Kowalski. Make sure everything's documented properly."

"Yeah."

As they walked toward the door, Matt stopped. "Your brother. The one from Missouri. Did he ever—did he ever find peace with it?"

Brandon's expression went distant. "No. He's still looking for her. Still trying to solve it. Some people—some cases—they never let you go."

Matt understood. Sarah Carpenter's case would have been like that for Linda Carpenter. For Thorndale. A wound that never healed because there were no answers.

But now there were answers. Because Brandon Gray had stood in a barn and felt what happened there. Had sat across from a killer and known things he couldn't possibly know.

And Matt still didn't understand how. But he was starting to accept that maybe understanding wasn't the point.

Maybe some things just were.
