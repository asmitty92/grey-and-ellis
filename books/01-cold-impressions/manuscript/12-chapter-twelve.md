# Chapter Twelve
**Thursday Morning**

The federal holding facility looked the same as it had four days ago when they'd first interviewed Dale Kovacs. Same parking lot, same industrial landscape, same sense of existing between places. Brandon watched Matt park the sedan in a visitor spot, neither of them in a hurry to get out.

"You ready for this?" Matt asked.

Brandon nodded. They'd spent the past three days processing Marcus Kowalski's confession, coordinating with the prosecutor's office, writing reports. The arraignment was scheduled for Monday. But today they were here for Dale.

"He's taking the plea," Matt said. It wasn't a question.

"He'd be stupid not to," Brandon said. "Three counts: kidnapping, obstruction of justice, improper disposal of human remains. The prosecutor's offering five years with parole eligibility after three, contingent on his testimony at trial."

"Better than life without parole."

"Much better." Brandon opened his door. "He cooperated. Without his statement, we might not have connected Marcus to the case. That counts for something."

They walked across the parking lot. The morning was cold, the sky that flat gray that promised snow. Brandon pulled his jacket tighter. He'd barely slept the past few days. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw that barn. Felt Sarah's terror. Heard that single word: *why*.

Matt glanced at him as they approached the entrance. "You okay?"

"Yeah."

"You sure? Because we can have someone else handle this if—"

"I'm fine, Matt." Brandon stopped walking. "I appreciate you checking. But I'm fine."

Matt studied him for a moment, then nodded. This was new—Matt being more attentive, more aware. Since Monday night, since the confession, things between them had shifted. Not in a bad way. Just different. Matt knew now. About the impressions, about how Brandon worked. And instead of pulling back, Matt had leaned in. Asking questions. Trying to understand.

It was strange having someone know. But also—in many ways-it was a relief.

They checked in at the front desk, surrendered their weapons, went through security. The guard escorted them to the same conference room they'd used before. Dale sat at the table, wearing an orange jumpsuit, his hands folded in front of him. His lawyer, Gerald Hicks, sat beside him with a folder open.

Dale looked up when they entered. He'd aged in the past week. New lines around his eyes, gray at his temples that Brandon hadn't noticed before.

"Agents," Hicks said, standing to shake their hands. "Thank you for coming. I know this isn't required but Dale wanted to speak with you before we finalize the plea."

"We're glad to be here," Matt said.

They sat down across from Dale and Hicks. Brandon pulled out his notebook more out of habit than necessity. This wasn't an interrogation.

"The prosecutor's office sent over the final terms yesterday," Hicks said. He slid a document across the table. "Five years, credit for time served, parole eligibility after three years. In exchange for guilty pleas on all three counts and full cooperation including testimony at trial."

Matt scanned the document. "This is contingent on his testimony being truthful and complete."

"We understand," Hicks said. "Dale's prepared to testify to everything he told you. About Marcus, about finding Sarah, about what he did afterward."

"And the prosecutor knows that testimony will include admitting he held Sarah in his house for three days without calling authorities," Matt said. "That he disposed of her body. That he destroyed evidence."

"Yes." Hicks looked at Dale. "My client understands the implications. But he also understands that without his cooperation, Marcus Kowalski might never have been caught."

Dale spoke for the first time. His voice was hoarse. "I want to do this. I want to testify. Sarah deserves that. Her mother deserves that."

Brandon watched Dale's face. The guilt there was real. The remorse. But also fear—fear of what testifying would mean, fear of the consequences of his choices.

"The trial's scheduled for March," Matt said. "You'll likely testify in early April. Defense will probably cross-examine you aggressively. Try to make you look like the real killer and suggest Marcus's confession was coerced."

"I know," Dale said. "Mr. Hicks explained all that."

"And you're still willing?"

"Yes." Dale's jaw set. "I made some terrible mistakes. But I didn't kill Sarah. Marcus did. And I need to make sure everyone knows that."

Matt nodded and pushed the document back across the table. "Then I think this is a fair deal. Agent Gray?"

Brandon had been quiet, just watching. Now he leaned forward slightly. "Mr. Kovacs, do you understand that even with this plea, even with cooperation, you'll still serve time? That you'll have a felony record?"

"I understand."

"And you're accepting that?"

"What choice do I have?" Dale's voice cracked. "I can't undo what I did. Can't bring Sarah back. The least I can do is tell the truth about what happened."

"The truth helps," Brandon said. "It won't erase what you did. But it helps."

Dale nodded, tears forming in his eyes. Hicks handed him a tissue.

"There's one more thing," Dale said after a moment. He wiped his eyes. "Something I need to ask."

"Go ahead," Matt said.

Dale looked directly at Brandon. "If I'd called 911 that first morning—when I found her in the barn, when she was still alive—could I have saved her?"

The room went quiet. Hicks shifted uncomfortably. Matt's pen stopped moving.

Brandon held Dale's gaze. This was the question that had been eating at Dale for six months. The question that would eat at him for the rest of his life.

"I don't know," Brandon said honestly. "She was drugged. Disoriented. Scared. If you'd called immediately, paramedics could have treated her. Police could have set up protection. Marcus might not have been able to get to her."

"So I could have saved her," Dale said. His voice was barely a whisper.

"Maybe," Brandon said. "But maybe not. Marcus was a deputy sheriff. He had access to the investigation. He knew where you lived. If he'd wanted to get to Sarah badly enough, he might have found a way regardless. You might even have triggered him into acting sooner and killing both of you."

"But I gave him the opportunity," Dale said. "By not calling. By trying to handle it myself."

"Yes," Brandon said. There was no point in lying. "You gave him the opportunity. And that was wrong. But Dale—Marcus is the one who killed her. Not you. He strangled her. He took her life. That's on him, not you."

Dale put his head in his hands. His shoulders shook.

Hicks put a hand on his client's shoulder. "Dale, if you're ready, we should sign the plea agreement."

Dale nodded without looking up. Hicks pulled out a pen and set the papers in front of Dale. After a moment, Dale lifted his head, wiped his eyes, and signed.

His hand shook with every letter.

Outside, walking back to the car, Matt was quiet. Brandon knew that look. His partner was processing, thinking through implications.

"You think he'll hold up at trial?" Matt asked once they were in the car.

"I think so," Brandon said. "He wants to do the right thing. Finally."

"Defense is going to tear him apart."

"Probably. But his testimony corroborates Marcus's confession. And they have physical evidence—the box, the name changes, witness statements. Even if Dale falls apart on the stand, they have enough."

Matt started the engine but didn't put the car in gear. "That question he asked. About whether he could have saved her."

"Yeah."

"You think he could have?"

Brandon looked out the window at the gray sky. "Honestly? I don't know. If he'd called 911 immediately, if he'd told the truth about finding her—maybe. But Marcus was desperate. Obsessed. He'd been planning this for years. Even if Dale had done everything right, Marcus might have found another way."

"But we'll never know."

"No. We'll never know." Brandon turned to look at Matt. "That's what Dale has to live with. Not just what he did do, but what he didn't do. The call he didn't make. The choice that might have changed everything."

Matt was quiet for a moment. Then he put the car in reverse and backed out of the parking spot.

"Where to now?" he asked.

Brandon checked his watch. Ten-thirty. "Linda Carpenter. We should tell her about the plea deal before she hears it from the prosecutor."

Matt nodded and headed toward the highway. Neither of them spoke for several miles.

Then Matt said, "That thing you told Dale. About Marcus being responsible, not him. You believe that?"

"Yes," Brandon said. "Dale made unfortunate choices. But Marcus is the killer. There's a difference between enabling something and causing it."

"But Dale feels responsible anyway."

"Of course he does." Brandon watched the farmland roll past. "That's the thing about guilt. It doesn't care about logic or proportional responsibility. It just sits there, heavy, reminding you of what you could have done differently."

Matt glanced at him. "You speaking from experience?"

Brandon thought about Missouri. About being ten years old and feeling like he should have known something, should have seen something, should have saved someone he loved. About twenty-one years of carrying that weight.

"Yeah," he said quietly. "I guess I am."

They drove the rest of the way to Thorndale in comfortable silence.

Linda Carpenter’s house looked different in November. The flower beds that had been mulched in October were now covered with a light dusting of frost. The American flag on the porch hung limp in the still air. A wreath on the front door—simple, understated, the kind you’d see at a funeral home.

Brandon noticed these things as Matt parked on the street. Small changes that marked time passing. Six months since Sarah disappeared. One week since they’d found her body. Three days since Marcus Kowalski had confessed to killing her.

“You want to take the lead on this one?” Brandon asked.

Matt shook his head. “You’re better with families.”

I'm not sure that's true.” Brandon looked at his partner. “You know how to relate to people. I just tell them the truth.”  

“The truth is what she needs,” Matt said. But he didn’t move to get out of the car.

Brandon understood the hesitation. This was the hardest part of the job. Not the investigation, not the interrogation, not even the arrest. It was this—sitting across from a mother and telling her how her daughter died. Knowing that every word would be something she’d replay in her mind for the rest of her life.

“We could call Dunham,” Matt said. “Have him do this.”

“We could,” Brandon agreed. “But we’re the ones who solved it. We’re the ones who got the confession. She deserves to hear it from us.”

Matt nodded. They got out of the car.

The front door opened before they reached the porch. Linda stood in the doorway wearing jeans and a sweatshirt, her hair pulled back. She looked older than she had two weeks ago. Thinner. Hollowed out.

“Agents,” she said. Her voice was steady but flat. “I’ve been expecting you.”

“Mrs. Carpenter,” Matt said. “Thank you for seeing us. May we come in?”

She stepped aside. They entered the living room—the same room they’d sat in before, surrounded by photos of Sarah. But now there was something new on the coffee table. A framed photo of Sarah from high school, surrounded by candles. A memorial.

“Would you like coffee?” Linda asked.

“We’re fine, thank you,” Matt said.

They sat on the couch. Linda took the armchair across from them, her hands folded in her lap. Waiting.

“Mrs. Carpenter,” Matt started, “we wanted to update you personally on the status of the investigation. The prosecutor’s office will be reaching out formally, but we thought you should hear it from us first.”

“You arrested someone,” Linda said. “The news said it was a deputy sheriff. Miles Kowalski.”

“Yes ma’am,” Matt said. “His real name is Marcus Harding. He was Dale Kovacs’s stepson. He lived with Dale just outside Thorndale from age twelve to twenty-one.”

Linda’s expression didn’t change. Like she’d already processed this information, already accepted it. “The boy who made Sarah uncomfortable at church.”

“Yes,” Brandon said. “Marcus developed an obsession with Sarah when they were both young. It never went away. When he became a deputy sheriff and returned to the area, he started watching her again.”

“And he killed her,” Linda said. Still flat. Still emotionless.

“Yes,” Matt said. “He confessed three days ago. Gave us details about what happened. We wanted to come tell you in person, and to answer any questions you might have.”

Linda was quiet for a long moment. When she spoke, her voice was very small. “Did she suffer?”

Brandon had been dreading this question. But he’d known it was coming.

“She was afraid,” he said gently. “Marcus took her from the Crossroads and brought her to Dale’s barn. He’d drugged her—she wasn’t fully conscious for the beginning of it. When she woke up, she was confused. Disoriented.” 

“But did she suffer?” Linda asked again. Her eyes were fixed on Brandon’s face.

Brandon thought about the impression from the barn. The terror. The desperate clawing at the dirt. The single word: *why*.

“Yes,” he said quietly. “I’m sorry, Mrs. Carpenter. Yes, she suffered.”

Linda’s hands tightened in her lap. A single tear rolled down her cheek, but her expression didn’t change.

“How long?” she asked. “How long before—before she died?”

“Marcus kept her in the barn initially, then Dale found her and moved her to his house,” Matt said. “She was there for three days. Then Marcus came back and took her to the barn again. That’s when—” He stopped.

“That’s when he killed her,” Linda finished.

“Yes ma’am.”

“Was it quick?”

Brandon and Matt exchanged a glance. This was the question victims’ families always asked. And the answer was never what they wanted to hear.

“He strangled her,” Brandon said. “It would have taken a few minutes.”

Linda closed her eyes. More tears now, streaming down her face. But still quiet. Still controlled.

“Why?” she asked. “Why Sarah? She was just a girl working at a library. She wasn’t hurting anyone. Why did he—” Her voice broke.

“Because he believed she was the only person in the world who understood him,” Brandon said. “He’d built up a fantasy in his mind over thirteen years. About how they had this special connection. How he was supposed to protect her. When that fantasy shattered—when Sarah didn’t see him the way he saw her—he couldn’t accept it.”

“So he killed her,” Linda said.

“Yes.”

“Because she didn’t love him back.”

“Yes.”

Linda opened her eyes. “That’s not a reason. That’s not—that doesn’t make any sense.”

“It doesn’t,” Matt agreed. “People like Marcus—they build these narratives to justify their actions. To him, he was protecting her. Even when he was killing her.”

“He told her he loved her,” Brandon said quietly. “While his hands were around her throat.”

Linda’s face crumpled. “Oh god. Oh god, my baby.”

Matt leaned forward. “Mrs. Carpenter, I know this is incredibly difficult. But I need you to know—Sarah fought. She didn’t give up. Even in those final moments, she was trying to leave evidence. Trying to make sure someone would know what happened to her.”

“The bracelet,” Linda said through her tears. “The news said you found her bracelet.”

“Yes,” Brandon said. “She pulled it off and buried it where Marcus couldn’t see. So we’d know she’d been there.”

“That’s my Sarah,” Linda whispered. “Always thinking. Always smart.”

They sat in silence for a moment. Linda crying quietly. Matt and Brandon waiting.

Finally Linda wiped her eyes. “What happens now?”

“Marcus is being held without bail,” Matt said. “His trial is scheduled for March. Dale Kovacs has agreed to testify about what he knows. The prosecutor is confident they’ll get a conviction.”

“And Dale?” Linda asked. “What about him?”

“He’s taking a plea deal,” Matt said. “Five years for kidnapping, obstruction, and improper disposal of remains. He cooperated fully with the investigation.”

“Five years,” Linda said. “My daughter is dead and he gets five years.”

“I know it doesn’t seem fair—”

“It’s not fair,” Linda interrupted. Her voice was stronger now. Angry. “He kept her in his house for three days. He buried her body. He let Marcus get away with it for six months. And he gets five years.”

“You’re right,” Brandon said. “It’s not fair. But without Dale’s cooperation, we might not have caught Marcus. The physical evidence alone wasn’t enough. We needed Dale’s testimony.”

Linda shook her head. “I know. I know you did your jobs. I know you did everything you could. But it’s not fair.”

“No,” Brandon agreed. “It’s not.”

They sat for another moment. Then Linda stood. “I need—I need to be alone now. I’m sorry.”

Matt and Brandon stood as well. “Of course,” Matt said. “We’ll go. But Mrs. Carpenter—if you have any other questions, any time, you can call us. Day or night.”

He handed her his card. Linda took it without looking at it.

“The coroner’s office will be in touch about Sarah’s remains,” Matt continued. “They’ve been released. You can make arrangements whenever you’re ready.”

Linda nodded. “They called this morning. The funeral will early next-Monday or Tuesday. At Thorndale Community Church. Two o’clock.”

“We’ll be there if you’d like us to be,” Matt said.

“No.” Linda’s voice was quiet but firm. “No, I don’t think that would be appropriate. This is for family. For people who knew her. Who loved her.”

Brandon understood. They were the investigators. The ones who’d brought closure. But they weren’t mourners. They didn’t belong at Sarah’s funeral.

“We understand,” he said.

Linda walked them to the door. As Brandon stepped onto the porch, he glanced back. Linda was standing in the doorway, one hand on the frame, looking small and broken.

On the table behind her, Brandon could see Sarah’s library badge sitting next to the memorial photo. A small laminated rectangle with her smiling face. The badge she’d worn every day at work. The badge that had been found in her car six months ago.

Linda was keeping it close. A piece of the daughter she’d never see again.

“Mrs. Carpenter,” Brandon said, turning back. “Sarah was brave. In those final moments. I need you to know that.”

Linda looked at him. “How do you know?”

“I just do,” Brandon said.

She held his gaze for a long moment. Then nodded. “Thank you.”

She closed the door.

Matt and Brandon walked back to the car in silence. Once they were inside, Matt let out a long breath.

“Jesus,” he said.

“Yeah.”

They sat for a moment, neither moving to start the car.

“You know what the worst part is?” Matt said finally.

“What?”

“We gave her answers. We told her exactly what happened to her daughter. And it didn’t help. She’s not any less broken than she was before.”

“No,” Brandon agreed. “She’s not. Because answers aren’t closure. They’re just… information. The grief doesn’t go away. It just gets a story attached to it.”

Matt started the engine. “One more stop. Dunham.”

“Yeah.”

As they pulled away from Linda Carpenter’s house, Brandon looked back one more time. The wreath on the door. The frost on the flower beds. The house where a mother would spend the rest of her life missing her daughter.

Some wounds never healed.

You just learned to live with them.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

---

The Parke County Sheriff’s Office was quiet when they arrived just after one PM. Most of the deputies were out on patrol or at lunch. The dispatcher at the front desk recognized them and waved them through.

They found Dunham in his office, staring at his computer screen. He looked up when they knocked, and Brandon saw the exhaustion in his face. The man had aged a decade in the past week.

“Ellis. Gray.” Dunham gestured to the chairs across from his desk. “Come in. Close the door.”

They sat. Brandon noticed the file folders stacked on Dunham’s desk—personnel records, incident reports, years of documentation. Dunham caught him looking.

“Background checks,” Dunham said. “Every deputy we’ve hired in the past five years. Going through them all again. Making sure we didn’t miss anything else.”

“You won’t find anything,” Matt said. “Kowalski was clean. His background check was thorough. There was nothing to find.”

“Marcus Harding,” Dunham corrected. “That’s who I hired. Marcus Harding pretending to be Miles Kowalski. And I didn’t catch it.”

“The name change was legal,” Brandon said. “It wouldn’t have shown up unless you specifically searched for prior names. Which no one does for standard background checks.”

“I still should have noticed something in the 2 years i supervised him,” Dunham said. “I just can't believe i missed it.”

“Because he was good at hiding,” Matt said. “He’d been practicing since he was a teenager. The mask he wore—that wasn’t new. That was years of refinement.”

Dunham picked up a photo from his desk. Brandon recognized it—the department’s staff photo from last year. Dunham, Kowalski, and the rest of the deputies standing in front of the courthouse.

“Look at him,” Dunham said, pointing to Kowalski in the photo. “He looks normal. Happy. Like any other deputy just doing his job.”

“He was doing his job,” Brandon said. “That’s what made him dangerous. He was functional. Competent. He blended in perfectly because he’d learned how to mimic normalcy.”

“But there had to be signs,” Dunham insisted. “Something I should have seen. Some behavior, some comment, something that should have tipped me off.”

Matt leaned forward. “Tom, I’ve been doing this for over fifteen years. I’ve investigated dozens of homicides. And I can tell you—people like Marcus don’t show obvious signs. They’re not walking around with red flags. They compartmentalize. The Marcus who showed up to work was different from the Marcus who was obsessed with Sarah Carpenter. Two separate people in the same body.”

“Agent Gray,” Dunham said, looking at Brandon. “You figured it out. You knew Marcus was right for this. What did you see that I didn’t?”

Brandon chose his words carefully. “I didn’t see it in him. I saw it in the case. The way the investigation was handled, the evidence that was collected—or wasn’t collected. The fact that the first officer on scene was also someone who’d been visiting the library where Sarah worked. Those patterns pointed to someone with access and knowledge.”

“But if you’d worked with him every day,” Dunham pressed, “would you have known? Would you have seen it?”

Brandon thought about that. About all the times he’d stood next to someone who was hiding something. About how good people could be at concealing their true nature.

“Probably not,” Brandon admitted. “Not unless I was specifically looking for it. And even then—Marcus was careful. He’d been careful his entire adult life.”

Dunham set the photo down. “The mayor wants a press conference. Wants me to explain how this happened. How a deputy sheriff in my department murdered a young woman and investigated his own crime for six months.”

“What are you going to tell them?” Matt asked.

“The truth. That Marcus Harding changed his name, had no criminal record, passed a background check, and became a deputy sheriff. That he hid his obsession with Sarah Carpenter. That when we reopened the case as a cold case, he volunteered to help because he wanted to stay close to the investigation. And that he was caught because two FBI agents saw patterns we missed.” Dunham looked between them. “That about cover it?”

“Sounds right,” Matt said.

They sat in silence for a moment. Brandon could hear the dispatcher talking on the radio in the front office. A deputy calling in a traffic stop on Route 36.

“Your department will survive this,” Matt said. “It’ll be hard. The media will be brutal. Public trust will take a hit. But you’ll get through it.”

“Will we?” Dunham asked. “Because I’m not sure. Kowalski was one of us. Wore the same uniform. Took the same oath. And he used that access to murder someone. How do we come back from that?”

“By doing the job,” Brandon said. “By being transparent about what happened and what you’re doing to prevent it from happening again. By showing the community that one bad deputy doesn’t define the entire department.”

Dunham nodded, but he didn’t look convinced.

“Tom,” Matt said. "The sheriff called us when Sarah’s case went cold. You asked for help. You gave us full access to your files, your deputies, your investigation. You didn’t try to cover anything up or protect your own. That matters.”

“Does it?” Dunham asked. “Because from where I’m sitting, it looks like I brought in the FBI to clean up a mess I should have prevented.”

“You couldn’t have prevented this,” Brandon said firmly. “Marcus was going to fixate on Sarah regardless of what you did or didn’t do. The obsession started when he was seventeen. Long before you hired him. Long before he became a cop. You’re not responsible for what he did.”

“But I am responsible for not seeing it,” Dunham said.

“No,” Brandon said. “You’re responsible for doing your job. Which you did. You investigated thoroughly. You called for help when you needed it. And when we identified Marcus as the killer, you supported the arrest without hesitation. That’s what you’re responsible for. The rest—that’s on Marcus.”

Dunham was quiet for a long moment. Then he pulled open his desk drawer and took out a business card. He slid it across the desk to Matt.

“If another case comes up,” Dunham said. “Something we can’t handle. You’ll come back?”

Matt picked up the card. “You have our direct numbers. Call anytime.”

“I mean it,” Dunham said. “You two—you’re good at this. You see things we miss. I’d rather call you in early than wait until it’s too late.”

“We appreciate that,” Matt said.

Brandon stood. “Chief Deputy, you’re going to second-guess yourself for a while. That’s normal. But eventually you’ll realize you did everything you could with the information you had. And that’s all anyone can do.”

Dunham stood as well. “How long does that take? The not second-guessing yourself part?”

Brandon thought about Missouri. About twenty-one years of wondering if he could have done something different. “I’ll let you know when I figure it out.”

They shook hands. Dunham’s grip was firm despite the exhaustion in his face.

“Thank you,” Dunham said. “For solving this. For bringing Sarah home. For—for everything.”

“It’s the job,” Matt said.

“No,” Dunham said. “It’s more than that. And you know it.”
