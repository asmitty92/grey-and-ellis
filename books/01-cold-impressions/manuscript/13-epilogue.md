# Epilogue

The Indianapolis FBI field office occupied the fourteenth floor of a glass and steel tower on Pennsylvania Street. Thursday afternoon sunlight cut through the windows, casting long shadows across rows of cubicles where analysts worked phones and computers, building cases one detail at a time.

Brandon Gray sat at a borrowed desk, typing the final paragraphs of his report. Three days of work condensed into official language: victim profile, suspect identification, interview methodology, confession obtained. The words looked sterile on the screen, stripped of the weight they carried. Nothing about standing in Dale Kovacs’s barn feeling Sarah Carpenter’s final moments. Nothing about watching Marcus Kowalski’s mask shatter when confronted with impossible knowledge.

Just facts. Evidence. Procedure.

Matt Ellis stood at the printer, collecting the last pages of his own report. He’d written his account separately—his observations, his interview notes, his assessment of the confession’s validity. Between them, the two documents told the complete story of how Sarah Carpenter’s case was solved.

“Almost done?” Matt asked, walking over with the printed pages.

“Last paragraph.” Brandon hit a few more keys, then stopped. Stared at the cursor blinking on the screen.

Matt recognized that look. “What is it?”

“Nothing. Just thinking about Missouri.”

Matt set the papers down and leaned against the desk. They’d had this conversation three days ago, after Marcus’s confession. But he sensed Brandon needed to say something more.

“Twenty-one years,” Brandon said quietly. “My brother’s still looking for her. Still checking databases, following up on Jane Does, calling sheriffs in counties across three states. He can’t let it go.”

“And you?”

Brandon closed the laptop. “I used to think I’d solve it someday. I've been to that crime scene more times than I can count. I thought maybe my work with my work with the bureau would help me find the perpetrator. Finally give my brother answers.”

“But you don’t think that anymore.”

“No.” Brandon stood and walked to the window. Fourteen floors below, Indianapolis traffic moved in steady streams. People going home, going to dinner, going about their lives. “Some cases don’t have answers. Some people disappear and never get found. And you can spend your whole life chasing ghosts, or you can—”

He stopped. Matt waited.

“Or you can use what you learned from that loss to help someone else,” Brandon finished. “We spoke for Sarah Carpenter. Linda Carpenter got to bury her daughter. That matters. That has to be enough.”

“It is enough,” Matt said.

Brandon turned from the window. “Yeah. I think it is.”

They stood in silence for a moment. Then Matt checked his watch. “We should check in with Lindsay before we leave. Courtesy.”

They walked down the hallway to the corner office where Special Agent in Charge Robert Lindsay sat behind a desk covered with case files. He looked up when they knocked, waved them in.

“Ellis. Gray. Heard you closed the Carpenter case. Good work.”

“Thank you, sir,” Matt said. They both remained standing. This wasn’t a long conversation.

“Confession hold up?”

“Solid. Recorded, witnessed, and voluntary. He waived counsel in writing. Defense will try to suppress it, but they won’t succeed.”

Lindsay nodded. “Good. Your SAC at Quantico will be pleased. He called yesterday, said you two have been making a name for yourselves with these cold cases.” He pulled a file from his desk. “This is the formal commendation for the Carpenter case. Should process through in the next month or so.”

“Appreciated,” Matt said.

“You heading back to Virginia or on to the next one?”

“Next one,” Matt said. “Got a few cases in the queue we’re reviewing.”

Lindsay stood and shook their hands. “Well, thanks for the assist on this. Parke County’s grateful, even if they’re still processing what happened. Let me know if you’re ever back in Indiana.”

“Will do.”

After they left Lindsay's office, they walked back to the borrowed desk where Brandon had been working. His laptop sat closed, his few personal items already packed in his messenger bag.

Matt sat down and opened his own laptop, pulling up their case queue. A spreadsheet appeared—thirty-seven open cases, color-coded by priority and age. Red for urgent, yellow for active, blue for cold. Most were blue.

Brandon looked over his shoulder. “What are we thinking?”

“Something Midwest,” Matt said, scrolling through the list. “Keep us in the region for now.” He clicked on a few files, reading summaries. “We’ve got an unsolved arson-homicide in Duluth. Three-year-old case, no suspects. A missing college professor in Madison, disappeared eight months ago. And this one—” He clicked on another file. “Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Unsolved homicide from last March.”

“Tell me about Cedar Rapids,” Brandon said.

Matt opened the full case file. A photo appeared—a young woman with dark hair and bright eyes, smiling at the camera. “Emily Reeves. Twenty years old, sophomore at Coe College. Disappeared from her apartment last March twenty-seventh. Body was found four days later in a wooded area near the Cedar River. Cause of death: blunt force trauma to the head.”

“What’s the local status?”

“Cedar Rapids PD worked it hard for three months. No suspects, no witnesses, no clear motive. Her apartment showed no signs of forced entry. Her car was in the parking lot, purse and phone were inside. Security footage shows her leaving the building at ten PM that night, but after that—nothing. Her body was found by a jogger about two miles from campus.”

Brandon studied the photo. “Why us?”

“Because the locals are stuck. They’ve interviewed everyone in her life—friends, family, professors, coworkers. She worked part-time at a coffee shop near campus. By all accounts, she was a good student, no enemies, no risk factors. But someone killed her, and nine months later they still don’t know who.”

Matt scrolled through more details. “Her father’s a state senator, so there was political pressure initially. But that’s died down. Now it’s just another cold case collecting dust.”

“Except we might see something they didn’t,” Brandon said quietly.

“That’s the theory.” Matt closed the file. “Cedar Rapids has formally requested federal assistance. They’ll give us full access to evidence, witness statements, everything. And there’s a crime scene we can visit. Might be worth a look.”

Brandon thought about standing in another place where violence had occurred. Feeling for impressions. Seeing if he could sense something the investigators had missed.

“When do they expect us?”

“No rush. It’s been nine months. A few more days won’t matter.” Matt looked at his partner. “But I’m thinking we head up tomorrow. If we get there on a Friday, we can spend the weekend reviewing the case, start the real work on Monday.”

“Works for me.”

They gathered the rest of their materials, submitted their reports to the administrative assistant, and headed for the elevator. The field office continued its work around them—phones ringing, printers humming, the steady machinery of federal law enforcement grinding through cases and evidence and the endless pursuit of truth.

In the elevator, Matt reopened the file on his phone and skimmed the details. “Cedar Rapids is about six hours northwest. We can drive up tomorrow morning, be there by early afternoon.”

Brandon nodded. He was already thinking about the case. A college student who disappeared at night. A body found four days later. Blunt force trauma. No obvious suspects.

The elevator opened on the ground floor. They walked through the lobby and out into the late afternoon cold. The parking garage was two blocks away. They walked in silence, both of them already shifting mental gears from the Carpenter case to whatever waited for them in Cedar Rapids.

Their vehicle was on the third level. A dark blue SUV, government issue, anonymous and practical. They loaded their bags in the trunk. Matt got behind the wheel. Brandon took the passenger seat.

For a moment, neither of them moved to leave.

“You ever wonder if we make a difference?” Matt asked. His hands rested on the steering wheel, eyes forward. “Real difference, I mean. We solve cases, catch killers. But the people are still dead. The families are still broken. Does it actually change anything?”

Brandon thought about Linda Carpenter’s face when they’d told her how Sarah died. The pain there. The grief. The answers that didn’t bring comfort but did bring truth.

“I don’t know if we change anything,” Brandon said. “But we give people truth. And sometimes truth is all they have left.”

He thought about Missouri again. About his brother still searching after twenty-one years. About the truth that never came and the weight of not knowing.

“Sarah Carpenter’s mother got to bury her daughter,” Brandon continued. “She knows what happened. She knows Sarah fought. She knows her daughter tried to leave evidence so someone would find her. That’s not nothing, Matt. That’s something.”

Matt nodded slowly. “Yeah. I guess it is.”

He started the engine. The sedan rumbled to life.

“Back to the hotel tonight, early start tomorrow?” Brandon asked.

“Yeah. We’ll grab dinner, get some sleep, head out around seven.” Matt pulled out of the parking space. “Should put us in Cedar Rapids by early afternoon. Give us time to check in with the local PD, review their case file, maybe drive by the crime scene before dark.”

They descended through the parking garage levels, past rows of cars belonging to people working normal jobs with normal hours. Out onto Pennsylvania Street, merging into evening traffic. The city moved around them—people heading home, lights coming on in office windows, the ordinary rhythm of a Thursday evening.

For Matt Ellis and Brandon Gray, Thursday evening meant preparation for the next case. Another unsolved homicide. Another family waiting for answers. Another chance to use what they knew, what they’d learned, what Brandon could sense in ways neither of them fully understood.

Matt navigated through downtown traffic toward their hotel. Brandon pulled out his phone and started making notes about the Cedar Rapids case. Questions to ask. People to interview. Details that might matter.

“What are you thinking?” Matt asked after a few blocks.

“That she left her apartment at ten PM voluntarily. No signs of struggle, no forced entry. So either she was meeting someone she knew, or she was just going for a walk and encountered someone.”

“Cedar Rapids PD interviewed everyone she knew. Friends, boyfriend, study partners. Everyone had alibis.”

“Then we look at who she might have encountered. Who else was in that area that night. Security footage from other buildings. Traffic cameras.” Brandon made another note. “And we visit the site where her body was found. See what we can see.”

Matt glanced at his partner. He’d seen Brandon work crime scenes before. Seen him stand in places where terrible things had happened and somehow piece together what the physical evidence couldn’t tell them. It still unnerved him sometimes, but after the Carpenter case—after seeing it work so dramatically—Matt had stopped questioning it.

“Nine months cold,” Matt said. “Trail’s pretty dead by now.”

“Maybe,” Brandon said. “But dead trails are our specialty.”

They pulled into the hotel parking lot. A Quality Inn on the southwest side of the city, functional and forgettable. They’d been staying here all week while working the Carpenter case.

“Breakfast at six, on the road by seven?” Matt asked as they got out.

“I’ll be ready.”

They headed to their separate rooms. Brandon set his bag down and looked out the window at the Indianapolis skyline. Tomorrow they’d drive to Iowa. Another city, another case, another family whose lives had been shattered by violence.

But tonight, he could rest. Could let the Carpenter case settle. Could prepare himself for whatever waited in Cedar Rapids.

He thought about Emily Reeves. Twenty years old. Music major. Worked at a coffee shop. Disappeared one night and turned up dead four days later. Nine months of her family wondering why. Nine months of her killer walking free.

Not for much longer, if Brandon and Matt had anything to say about it.

He closed the curtains and lay down on the bed. Tomorrow would come soon enough. Another case. Another chance to give someone answers.

The work continued. It always did.

And for now, that was enough.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
