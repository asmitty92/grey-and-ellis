# Revision checklist

## High priority

1) Prologue — trim repeated exposition & tighten reveal
    - Lines: 4–106 (whole prologue)
    - Why: The prologue has strong material but repeats the same factual beats (camera coverage, truck description, “she knew him” theme) several times. Tightening keeps the tension and improves pace.
    - What to do:
        - Combine multiple camera/vehicle facts into one concise paragraph (pick the clearest phrasing and remove duplicates later).
        - Remove one or two of the “we got her on phone / truck pulled away / purse left” restatements that appear in adjacent paragraphs.
        - Keep the slow reveal about Gray (the ritual at the payphone) but shorten repetitive lines before the final line “She knew him.”
    - Example replacement (replace redundant paragraphs around lines 30–36 and 82–90 with one short paragraph):
        - Replace the repeated camera/truck paragraphs with:
            - “The mounted camera caught only the edge of the payphone area—three minutes of Sarah on the line, a truck bleeding into frame, someone stepping out. Thirty seconds later the truck left; her purse and keys remained. Brennan emerged a minute later and called 911.”
    - Small show-edit: change “Gray had sat down on the concrete pad beneath the payphone, his back against the wall. His eyes were closed.” (lines ~86–89) to something like:
        - “Gray settled onto the concrete pad beneath the payphone, shoulders easing, thumbs worrying a loose thread in his jacket as his eyes closed.” — this is more specific, shows ritual.

2) Strengthen Matt’s presence (introduce a small recurring beat)
    - Lines to update (insert beats in these 3–5 places): 123, 187, 245, 269, 736
    - Why: You want Matt to remain strong (60/40) vs. Brandon. A tiny recurring physical beat (not an expositional paragraph) will make him feel present across chapters without stealing focus.
    - Suggested beat: “Matt’s thumb tapped a short, nervous rhythm against the table edge” OR “Matt chewed the inside corner of his lip when puzzling through a timeline.”
    - Example placements & short insertions:
        - After line 123 (right after the pattern sentence): add a single sentence: “Matt’s thumb tapped once against the table rim — a small rhythm that tightened whenever a new inconsistency appeared.”
        - After line 187 (after Matt leans back): “He rubbed the bridge of his nose, thumbnail catching a thin cut he’d picked at without noticing.”
        - At line 245 (pay the check / outdoors breath): “Matt’s thumb found his phone, thumb stuttering over the screen as he tried to order his thoughts.”
    - Effect: These micro-beats are unobtrusive but accumulate and give Matt interiority and agency.

3) Show, don’t tell — make POV-specific swaps
    - Matt POV (show through action/observation rather than summary)
        - Locations: 152–156, 165–176, 187–195, 239–246, 281–286
        - Examples:
            - Replace “Brandon was quiet for a moment” (line ~219/153 area) with a micro-action: “Brandon’s fingers tapped the sugar packet; his mouth pressed into a thin line.”
            - Replace “Matt leaned back in the booth. Three years working with Brandon Gray, and he still couldn't pin down how his partner assembled these narratives.” (lines ~187–195) with: “Matt leaned back and watched Brandon’s hands assemble a story out of small facts; he rubbed his chin, trying to see the thread.”
    - Brandon POV (lean into associative memory, sensory detail)
        - Locations: 312–336, 320–333, 322–336 (Chapter Two start)
        - Examples:
            - Expand the sensory memory: instead of “He thought about the moments before an abduction...” show the small physical cues (tone of voice, a half step back) that Brandon recalls.
    - Why: Your alternating-POV plan works well; keep prologue procedural but in character chapters use more showing.

4) Continuity — lock the dates/timelines
    - Lines to audit: 2, 25, 108–110 (chapter headers), 221–227 (Ashford details), 277
    - Why: The prologue date (Oct 19, 2011) + references to “April sixteenth, last year” + “eighteen months ago” could create confusion if not internally consistent.
    - What to do:
        - Confirm prologue date and the “last year” reference match: e.g., if prologue is Oct 19, 2011 then “April 16, last year” = April 16, 2010. If other lines say “eighteen months ago,” verify arithmetic.
        - Specifically check line 277 (“eighteen months ago”) — that phrasing appears inconsistent with “last year” mentioned earlier. Either make it “eighteen months” throughout or adjust to a specific year.
    - Quick fix: replace vague phrasing (“last year”, “eighteen months ago”) with absolute dates where appropriate (e.g., “April 16, 2010” or “April, 2010”), or use a consistent time-from-now reference (e.g., “eighteen months earlier”).

## Medium priority (strengthen clarity & tension)

5) Consolidate vehicle facts & reduce repetition
    - Lines: 42, 157, 631, 640, 656, 658, 291–296
    - Why: Truck color/model is repeated many times. Mention it once (or twice for important beats) and then refer back with pronouns/behavior to avoid monotony.
    - What to do:
        - Keep the initial clear description (line ~42/157), then subsequent mentions can be shorter (“the same late‑nineties Silverado”).
        - Remove near-duplicates in adjacent paragraphs — e.g., after Kovacs drives away (lines ~656–659), a single confirmatory glance is enough; remove a second sentence repeating the model.

6) Make Kovacs ambiguous (seed red herrings / complicate antagonist)
    - Lines to inject or alter: 542–558 (Kovacs record), 624–637 (first Q&A), 656–661 (walk to truck)
    - Why: Right now Kovacs fits the suspect mold cleanly. If you want suspense, seed small details that complicate the picture — possible red herrings or small suspicious acts that could be explained innocently later.
    - Suggestions:
        - Add a small odd detail when Kovacs interacts with Patricia: a lingering question he asks (e.g., “Is the family okay?”) that looks like concern but could be guilt.
        - Insert a line where his alibi contains an oddly precise detail (e.g., he remembers the exact cereal he ate before coming in) — too precise alibis often feel suspicious.
        - Or add a seemingly unrelated neighbor comment later (when you visit his property) that places his truck elsewhere that night.
    - Specific micro-add: after line 629 (“I do, yes. Dark blue. Why?”), add: “He hesitated a hair longer than natural, then added, ‘Been in the family for years. Dad got it used.’” — that phrasing can be interpreted multiple ways later.

7) Vary sentence rhythm and verb choice
    - Lines to examine: 165–176, 179–190, 340–356, 718–735
    - Why: Many sentences use similar structure and neutral verbs (“said”, “looked”, “was”). Varying verbs and shortening/lengthening sentences increases rhythm and suspense.
    - What to do:
        - Replace some “said/looked/was” with stronger verbs or with an action beat. Break up long explanatory sentences with short, punchy lines at moments of tension.
    - Example swap:
        - Original (neutral): “Brandon shook his head. 'The car didn't break down. He sabotaged it.'”
        - Stronger: “Brandon shook his head, and the napkin between his fingers crumpled. 'He didn't have bad luck. He made the car sick.'”

## Lower priority (polish and optional additions)

8) Remove small redundancies across scenes (global cleanup)
    - Lines to check for trimming: 141–147 (phone call details repeated later at 304–312), 169–176 and 179–186 (car sabotage arguments repeated), 720–736 (memorial discussion repeats).
    - What to do:
        - Identify pairs of paragraphs that repeat the same fact and delete the weaker passage. If both add nuance, merge them.
    - Tip: Search for each key fact (truck, phone, time) and ensure it appears in the manuscript no more than 3 times total (initial presentation, follow-up, and payoff).

9) Annotate places to seed future clues (planning)
    - Useful insertion points for future plot payoffs:
        - Line ~44–50 (mini-mart register area): a detail on a customer who visited repeatedly; can be used as a red herring later.
        - Line ~446–456 (memorial board): one unsigned note with a unique phrase that later matches a witness quote or Kovacs’s handwriting (plant it now).
        - Line ~732–736 (Brandon photographing board): add a micro-observation — “one card smelled faintly of cigarette smoke” — you can later connect to a suspect who smokes.

10) Tighten dialogue tags and beats
    - Lines: wide distribution — many “he said/she said” tags are fine, but introduce more action beats at emotional moments (lines 98–106, 223–237, 622–640).
    - Example: change “He said” to an action (shifts, tucks chin) to show unspoken emotion.

11) Micro-edit examples to replace telling with showing
    - Replace telling: “Brandon was quiet for a moment” — with “Brandon’s jaw clenched; the sugar packet lay untouched.”
    - Replace “He thought about all the people who disappeared and never came home.” with “He imagined an empty chair at a kitchen table, another file thickening on his desk.”

12) Proof & line-level copyedits
    - After major edits: run a pass for comma use, sentence fragments, and small typos (e.g., “haphazerd” in earlier annotated draft — verify original file for any spelling slips).
    - Check capitalization/format in chapter headers and date line (line 2).

# Practical revision plan & estimated effort
- Pass 1 (30–60 minutes): Apply high-priority changes — tighten prologue, add Matt recurring beats at suggested lines, show-not-tell swaps in immediate spots, and fix the continuity dates.
- Pass 2 (45–90 minutes): Consolidate vehicle facts, add ambiguity detail for Kovacs (one or two lines), vary sentence rhythm in flagged paragraphs.
- Pass 3 (30–60 minutes): Global redundancy sweep, plant two micro-clues for later payoff, copyedit.

# Suggested exact edits to paste (quick copy-paste)
- Prologue tightening (replace original camera/truck cluster with):
    - At roughly lines 30–36 replace with:
        - “The mounted camera caught only the edge of the payphone area—three minutes of Sarah on the line, a truck blotting the frame, a figure stepping from the driver’s side. Thirty seconds later the truck left; her purse and keys stayed. Brennan came out, found the scene, called 911.”
- Matt recurring beat (insert after line 123):
    - “Matt’s thumb tapped a short, nervous rhythm on the table edge — a small habit when the pieces didn’t quite fit.”
- Show-not-tell example (replace lines ~86–89):
    - Replace “When he looked up again, Gray had sat down on the concrete pad beneath the payphone, his back against the wall. His eyes were closed.” with:
        - “Gray sat on the concrete pad beneath the payphone, shoulders easing. He folded his hands in his lap and breathed slowly, as if slowing his blood to hear the scene again.”
- Kovacs ambiguous detail (insert after line ~629):
    - Add: “He paused before answering, as if the question landed differently than he'd expected. ‘Been in the family for years,’ he said finally, the words soft and oddly specific.”

# Wrap-up / next step
- Tell me which of the three passes you want me to do next:
    - A: I’ll directly apply Pass 1 changes and return the edited file.
    - B: I’ll apply Pass 1+2 (more invasive) and return the edited file.
    - C: I’ll produce a sampled rewrite of one scene (Prologue or the library scene) so you can see the approach before I change the rest.
- Or, if you prefer to implement yourself, I can produce an exact patch (diff) or a commit-ready file to upload.
