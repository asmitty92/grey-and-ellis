# Prologue
**Wednesday, January 9, 2013, 2:15 PM**

The house sat at the end of a cul-de-sac in West Omaha's newest development, surrounded by empty lots waiting for spring construction. Karen Whitmore pulled into the driveway and noticed the silver Lexus still parked near the garage. She checked her watch—2:17 PM. The showing should have ended over an hour ago.

She'd left at noon to grab lunch and give the real estate agent time to show the property. Mike Palmer had been professional when they'd spoken that morning, asking permission to bring a serious buyer through. An investor from out of state, he'd said. Cash offer possible.

Karen had been eager to accommodate. The house had been on the market for four months. In January, serious buyers were rare.

But now Palmer's car sat in the driveway, and Karen felt the first flutter of unease. She pulled out her phone and checked for messages. Nothing.

She got out of her car and walked toward the front door. The January air was cold enough to see her breath. The development was quiet—no construction noise, no neighbors, just empty houses and frozen earth.

The front door stood slightly ajar.

Karen stopped on the porch. "Hello? Mr. Palmer?"

No answer.

She pushed the door open wider. "Mr. Palmer? Is everything okay?"

The foyer looked undisturbed. Hardwood floors gleaming, the chandelier she'd installed last month catching afternoon light through the windows. But there was something wrong about the silence. A weight to it.

Karen stepped inside. "Hello?"

Then she heard it—water running upstairs. Not just a faucet, but the distinct sound of a shower.

Her unease deepened into real alarm. Why would anyone be showering in a house for sale?

"Mr. Palmer?" She moved toward the stairs. "I'm the homeowner. I'm coming up."

The water sound grew louder as she climbed. At the top of the stairs, she saw the master bedroom door open. And beyond it, the bathroom.

Water on the tile floor, spreading into the carpet.

Karen's heart hammered. She pulled out her phone, thumb hovering over 911, and moved toward the bathroom.

The shower curtain was pulled back. Water cascaded from the showerhead, steam rising. And in the bathtub—

Karen stumbled backward, her phone clattering to the floor. A strangled sound escaped her throat.

A man lay in the tub, fully clothed. His white shirt was dark with blood. So much blood. Water mixed with it, swirling pink down the drain. His eyes were open, staring at nothing. His face was pale, slack.

Stab wounds. Karen could see at least five from where she stood. Maybe more. The water had diluted the blood but couldn't wash it all away.

She grabbed her phone with shaking hands and ran from the bathroom, from the bedroom, down the stairs. Out the front door into the cold January air.

Her fingers fumbled as she dialed 911.

"911, what's your emergency?"

"There's a—there's a body. In my house. A man. He's dead. Oh god, there's so much blood—"

"Ma'am, slow down. What's your address?"

Karen gave it, her voice high and thin. The dispatcher kept her on the line, asking questions, telling her help was on the way. Karen stood in her front yard, staring at the silver Lexus, trying to process what she'd just seen.

Mike Palmer. It had to be Mike Palmer. The real estate agent who'd shown her house that morning. Who'd brought a buyer. Who'd smiled and shaken her hand and promised to lock up when they were done.

Where was the buyer? The man Palmer had brought?

Karen's gaze moved past the Lexus to the empty street. No other cars. No movement. Just the sound of wind through the skeletal trees lining the development.

Somewhere in the distance, sirens began to wail.

She stayed in the yard, phone pressed to her ear, while the dispatcher's voice kept talking. Kept asking questions Karen couldn't answer.

Inside the house, water continued to run. Mixing with blood. Washing away evidence. Carrying secrets down the drain.

By the time the first patrol car pulled into the cul-de-sac three minutes later, Karen Whitmore was sitting on the curb, her arms wrapped around herself, shaking from more than just the cold.

She would learn later that Mike Palmer's expensive watch was missing from his wrist. That his wedding ring was gone. That his wallet was in his car, but his cell phone had been found downtown, discarded in a dumpster behind a restaurant.

She would learn that the buyer—the man who called himself Steven, who spoke with an East Coast accent and walked with a cane—had never existed in any database. That the phone number he'd given Palmer was a burner, already disconnected.

She would learn that the house she'd built with her own savings, the house that was supposed to secure her retirement, would sit empty for another year. That no one wanted to buy the place where a real estate agent had been murdered.

But in that moment, sitting on the curb with sirens growing louder, Karen Whitmore knew only one thing:

Someone had come to her house.

Someone had killed a man in her bathroom.

And whoever it was had simply walked away.

**Three Weeks Later**
**Minneapolis FBI Field Office**

Brandon Gray sat at a borrowed desk on the third floor, finishing the last paragraph of his report. The Jensen case had closed two days ago—an insurance fraud scheme that had escalated to murder when the partner got nervous. The confession had come after forty minutes of careful questioning. Matt had handled most of it. Brandon had just watched, waiting for the moment when the mask would crack.

It always did, eventually.

Matt Ellis stood by the window, phone pressed to his ear. He was nodding, listening, making occasional notes on a legal pad. Brandon could tell from his posture it wasn't a personal call. Work, then. Probably their supervisor at Quantico.

"Understood," Matt said. "Send me the file. We'll review it and let you know." He ended the call and turned to Brandon. "That was Markowitz."

Brandon saved his document and looked up. "Another case?"

"Omaha PD is requesting assistance. Professional hit, three weeks old. Local detectives have exhausted their leads." Matt sat down across from Brandon. "They've asked specifically for us."

"Why us?"

"Because we've closed eleven cases in the past eighteen months. Cedar Rapids, Madison, Sioux Falls—" Matt's mouth quirked slightly, "—and I'm quoting here—'Agents Ellis and Gray have a track record of solving cases other teams can't crack.'"

Brandon closed his laptop. "What's the case?"

Matt consulted his notes. "Victim is Michael Palmer, forty-two, real estate agent. Murdered during a property showing on January ninth. Stabbed nineteen times in an upscale house outside Omaha. Body was placed in a bathtub with the shower running."

"Staged," Brandon said.

"Heavily. The killer took the victim's watch and wedding ring but left cash in his wallet. Cell phone was found separately, downtown Omaha. Vehicle was abandoned at a shopping center."

"Professional."

"That's what Omaha PD thinks. The victim met with a potential buyer at a mall before driving to the showing. The buyer gave his name as Steven, said he was from Northern California, walked with a cane." Matt flipped a page. "Mall security footage shows a man matching the description, but he kept his face away from cameras. The whole thing feels orchestrated."

Brandon thought about that. "What's the motive?"

"That's the problem. There isn't one. At least, not an obvious one." Matt set down his notes. "Palmer was married, successful, well-liked. No financial problems, no debts, no enemies. His wife and business partner have been thoroughly vetted and cleared. Omaha PD has been working this for three weeks and they've hit every wall there is."

"So they called us."

"So they called us." Matt leaned back in his chair. "Markowitz is sending the full file. We can review it tonight, decide if we want to take it."

Brandon considered. A professional hit with no apparent motive. A killer who planned meticulously, executed cleanly, and disappeared completely. The kind of case that would stay cold without fresh perspective.

The kind of case that mattered.

"I'm in," Brandon said.

Matt smiled slightly. "Figured you would be. I already told Markowitz we'd take it."

"What happened to deciding?"

"I decided. You just confirmed I was right." Matt stood and grabbed his jacket. "We should head out first thing tomorrow. It's about six hours to Omaha. We can review the file on the drive, be there by early afternoon."

Brandon packed up his laptop and the few personal items he'd spread across the borrowed desk. They'd been in Minneapolis for almost two weeks, working the Jensen case out of the field office. Before that, it had been Madison. Before that, Sioux Falls. He'd gotten used to the rhythm—temporary office space, hotel rooms, rental cars, the transient life of agents who specialized in cases no one else wanted.

Matt was already at the door, checking his phone. "I'm messaging the lead detective now. Claire Morrison. Fifteen years with Omaha PD-eight of those in Homicide. Markowitz says she's good—thorough, professional, knows when to ask for help. That's why she called us."

They walked down the hallway together, past cubicles where analysts worked phones and computers, building cases one detail at a time. The Minneapolis office was smaller than Quantico but efficient. Brandon had worked out of a half-dozen field offices in the past year and a half. They all had the same rhythm, the same purpose.

In the elevator, Brandon said, "What made you decide that we were taking this one so quickly?"

Matt was quiet for a moment. "This one feels different. The staging, the professionalism. Whoever did this has done it before."

"Maybe."

"You don't think so?"

"I think," Brandon said carefully, "that we won't know until we see the scene. But yeah—it feels planned. Practiced."

The elevator opened on the ground floor. They walked out into the January cold, breath fogging in the air. The parking garage was across the street. Their rental sedan—a gray Taurus that looked like every other government vehicle—sat on the second level.

"Dinner first?" Matt asked. "Then we can review the file at the hotel."

"Sure."

They drove in comfortable silence, the kind that came from working together long enough to know when to talk and when to let quiet be enough. Brandon watched Minneapolis slide past the window—a city he'd learned in fragments over ten days, just long enough to know where to eat and how to avoid traffic.

Tomorrow they'd be in Omaha. Another city, another case, another family waiting for answers they might not want.

But tonight, they'd prepare. Matt would make his lists, organize his questions, map out their strategy. Brandon would study the photos, knowing he wouldn't truly understand until he stood in that bathroom where Michael Palmer had died.
