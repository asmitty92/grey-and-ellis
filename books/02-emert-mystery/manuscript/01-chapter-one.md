# Chapter One
**Thursday, January 31, 2013**

The highway stretched ahead through flat Minnesota farmland turning to Iowa cornfields, winter-bare and waiting for spring. Brandon watched the landscape scroll past—frozen earth, skeletal trees, gray sky promising snow that wouldn't come. January in the Midwest looked the same whether you were in Minneapolis or Omaha or anywhere in between.

Matt drove with one hand on the wheel, the other holding a travel mug of coffee. They'd left Minneapolis at seven-thirty, stopped for gas and breakfast in Albert Lea, and now had about three hours left before Omaha. The radio played quietly—some NPR story about budget negotiations that neither of them was really listening to.

Brandon had the case file open on his laptop, reading through the initial police reports for the third time. Sometimes details revealed themselves on subsequent readings. Sometimes you missed things the first time because you were looking for the obvious.

"What are you seeing?" Matt asked.

Brandon scrolled to the crime scene photos. Karen Whitmore had taken several with her phone before police arrived—documentation instinct overriding shock. The bathtub, the victim, the water still running. Then the official police photos, methodical and comprehensive.

"Staging," Brandon said. "But not for show. For purpose."

"Explain."

"The shower running wasn't about washing away evidence. Water doesn't remove everything. Any decent forensics team would still find trace." Brandon zoomed in on a photo showing the victim's position. "But it does dilute. Makes analysis harder. Slows things down."

"So the killer knew forensics but wasn't trying to completely erase evidence."

"Right. Just obscure it enough to buy time." Brandon closed the photo and pulled up the autopsy report. "Nineteen stab wounds. Medical examiner says the first three would have been fatal eventually. The rest were... excessive."

"Rage?"

"Maybe. Or certainty. Making sure the job was done." Brandon read through the wound descriptions. "No defensive wounds on the victim's hands. No signs of struggle. Toxicology was clean—no drugs, no alcohol, nothing that would impair his ability to fight back."

"So Palmer either knew his attacker and didn't see it coming, or—"

"Or the first strike was completely unexpected and immediately incapacitating." Brandon found the photo showing wound locations. "The first stab hit the subclavian artery. That's skill or luck. Either way, Palmer would have lost consciousness within seconds. The other eighteen wounds were insurance."

Matt was quiet for a moment, processing. "What about the jewelry? Watch and ring taken, cash left behind?"

"That bothers me." Brandon pulled up the evidence list. "Rolex Submariner, about eight thousand dollars. Wedding band, white gold, probably another two thousand. But his wallet had three hundred forty-seven dollars cash and four credit cards. All left in his vehicle."

"So not robbery."

"Unless the killer only wanted items that couldn't be traced. Cash can be spent anywhere. Credit cards leave records. But jewelry—" Brandon considered. "You can sell it for parts, melt it down, or keep it as a trophy."

"Trophy suggests a personal motive."

"Or a professional who collects from each job." Brandon closed the evidence file. "We won't know until we understand who Palmer really was."

Matt took a drink of coffee. They'd been doing this long enough that their thought processes had started to sync. Matt would work the logical angles—evidence, timelines, witness statements. Brandon would look for the psychological patterns, the things that didn't fit, the human element that logic sometimes missed.

"Tell me about Steven," Matt said.

Brandon pulled up the witness statements. "Palmer met him at Oak View Mall around eleven-thirty AM on January ninth. Security footage shows a man matching Steven's description arriving at eleven-twenty. He kept his face away from cameras—not obviously, just angled wrong every time."

"Professional awareness."

"Definitely. He met Palmer in the food court, they talked for about ten minutes, then left together. Palmer drove them in his Lexus to the showing in West Omaha." Brandon scrolled through the security stills. "Steven's description: white male, fifties, approximately five-eleven, medium build, wearing a dark coat and carrying a cane. Walked with a pronounced limp."

"The cane," Matt said. "That's specific."

"Patricia Morgan at the mall's Starbucks remembered him. Said he ordered black coffee, paid cash, waited at a corner table. She noticed the cane because it looked expensive—dark wood with a silver handle." Brandon found her statement. "She said he seemed calm, patient. Not nervous."

"Because he knew what he was about to do."

"Or because he'd done it before." Brandon pulled up another file. "Omaha PD ran the MO through ViCAP. No exact matches, but there were three similar cases in the past ten years. Real estate agents or property managers killed during showings. All in different states, all unsolved."

Matt's hands tightened slightly on the wheel. "Three others?"

"Kansas City in 2004. Charlotte in 2007. Phoenix in 2010." Brandon read through the summaries. "Different methods—one shooting, one strangulation, one blunt force trauma. But similar staging: isolated properties, meticulous planning, no obvious motive. And in the Phoenix case, the killer posed as a buyer with a physical disability. Used a wheelchair."

"So if it's the same person, he varies his approach."

"And his disability. Makes him memorable enough that witnesses remember him, but the details change. The Kansas City killer was supposedly deaf. Charlotte was blind in one eye. Phoenix was the wheelchair. Omaha is the cane and limp."

"Disguises," Matt said. "All of them."

"Probably. Which means Steven isn't his real name, the accent might be fake, and the limp is theater." Brandon closed that file. "But it also means he's done this before. Multiple times. Successfully."

They drove in silence for a while. Brandon watched the landscape change as they crossed into Iowa. More farmland, more gray sky, the occasional town breaking up the monotony. Albert Lea gave way to Clear Lake, then Mason City, then smaller places whose names he didn't catch.

"What's Morrison's take on all this?" Brandon asked.

Matt pulled out his phone and handed it to Brandon. "Read her last email. She sent it this morning."

Brandon opened the email app and found the message:

*Agents Ellis and Gray - Looking forward to working with you. I've compiled everything we have on Palmer, including financial records, client lists, interview transcripts, and surveillance footage. I'll brief you when you arrive, but here's the summary: Michael Palmer was exactly who he appeared to be. No secrets, no enemies, no reason for anyone to want him dead. Which is what makes this case impossible. See you at 2 PM. - Det. C. Morrison*

"She sounds frustrated," Brandon said.

"She's been working this for three weeks with nothing to show for it. I'd be frustrated too." Matt took his phone back. "But at least she's being thorough. That email had twelve attachments—financials, backgrounds, witness statements. She's done the work."

"Good. We can build on that instead of starting from scratch."

The highway stretched on. They passed through Mason City, then Northwood, then crossed into Iowa properly. The landscape didn't change much—still flat, still agricultural, still waiting for spring.

Brandon pulled up Palmer's background file. Forty-two years old, married to Jennifer Palmer for eighteen years. No children. Partners with David Rodriguez in Palmer-Rodriguez Real Estate for the past decade. Successful business, consistent income, no debts beyond a mortgage that was nearly paid off.

Palmer had grown up in Omaha, graduated from Creighton University with a business degree, got his real estate license at twenty-four. He'd worked for a larger firm for six years before starting his own company with Rodriguez. Member of Omaha Chamber of Commerce, volunteered with Habitat for Humanity, played golf at Oak Hills Country Club.

On paper, Michael Palmer was boring in the best possible way. Stable. Successful. Unremarkable.

Which meant the answer was buried deeper than paper.

"We need to talk to the wife," Brandon said. "Not just interview. Really talk to her."

"Morrison's report says Jennifer Palmer has been cooperative. Gave access to financials, client lists, everything."

"I don't doubt she's cooperative. But there's what people tell police and what they actually know." Brandon closed the file. "Eighteen years of marriage. Jennifer Palmer knows things about her husband that wouldn't show up in financial records or client lists."

"You think Palmer had secrets?"

"Everyone has secrets. The question is whether any of his were worth killing for."

Matt nodded slowly. "We'll talk to her. Morrison can set it up."

They drove through Fort Dodge, then Rockwell City, watching the mile markers count down. Brandon's mind kept circling back to the crime scene photos. Something about the staging bothered him beyond the obvious. The shower running, yes. The stolen jewelry, yes. But there was something else. Something in the way the body had been positioned.

He pulled up the photos again, studying them closely. Palmer lay on his back in the tub, arms at his sides, legs straight. Almost peaceful except for the blood and the wounds. The shower had been running long enough to fill the tub partway before the homeowner arrived, water mixing with blood, draining slowly.

"The tub was plugged," Brandon said.

Matt glanced over. "What?"

"Look at the photos. The water level is higher than it should be if the drain was open. Someone plugged the drain before turning on the shower."

"Why would they do that?"

"I don't know. To slow the drainage? To make sure the water covered the body completely?" Brandon zoomed in on the drain area. "It's hard to see in these photos, but I think there's something there. Maybe a cloth or a rubber stopper."

"Add it to the list of questions for Morrison." Matt checked the GPS. "We're about ninety minutes out. Should we stop for lunch or eat when we get there?"

"Let's eat there. Morrison probably knows good places."

They drove on through Carroll, then Denison, getting closer to Omaha with each passing mile. Brandon's mind was already at the crime scene, trying to understand what had happened in that bathroom. The planning, the execution, the staging. Every detail meant something. Even the ones that didn't seem to make sense.

Especially those.

By the time they reached the Omaha city limits, it was one-forty-five PM. Matt followed the GPS through downtown—older buildings mixed with new construction, the Missouri River visible to the east, the skyline modest but modern. Omaha had that Midwest city feel: functional, unpretentious, going about its business without trying to impress anyone.

The Omaha Police Department headquarters sat on the south edge of downtown, a newer building with clean lines and plenty of glass. Matt pulled into visitor parking and killed the engine.

"Ready?" he asked.

Brandon closed his laptop and packed it into his messenger bag. "Yeah."

They walked through the parking lot in the January cold, breath fogging. Inside, the lobby was warm and efficient—a reception desk, security checkpoint, waiting area with uncomfortable plastic chairs. Matt showed his badge to the officer at the desk.

"Special Agents Ellis and Gray. We're here to see Detective Morrison."

The officer made a phone call, spoke briefly, then nodded. "She'll be right down. You can wait here."

They stood near the elevator, watching people come and go. Patrol officers, detectives in plain clothes, civilians there to file reports or post bail. The rhythm of a functioning police department, the machinery of law enforcement grinding through its daily work.

The elevator opened and a woman stepped out. Late thirties, maybe five-eight, dark hair pulled back in a ponytail, wearing black pants and a gray blazer over a white shirt. She moved with purpose, scanning the lobby until her eyes landed on them.

"Agents Ellis and Gray?" She walked over, hand extended. "Claire Morrison, Homicide."

Matt shook her hand first. "Matt Ellis. This is Brandon Gray."

Brandon shook her hand too. Her grip was firm, professional, not trying to prove anything. Up close, he could see the tiredness in her eyes—three weeks of working a case that wouldn't break.

"Thanks for coming," Morrison said. "I've got a conference room set up with everything I've compiled. We can talk there."

They followed her to the elevator. Inside, Morrison pressed the button for the third floor.

"How was the drive?" she asked.

"Long but uneventful," Matt said. "We reviewed your files on the way. Thorough work."

"I wish it had gotten me somewhere." Morrison's voice was matter-of-fact, no self-pity. "I've worked homicides for eight years. This is the first one where I genuinely have no idea who did it or why."

"That's why you called us," Brandon said.

"That's why I called you."

The elevator opened on the third floor. Morrison led them down a hallway past cubicles and offices. The Homicide unit occupied the northeast corner—a bullpen of desks surrounded by filing cabinets and whiteboards covered with case notes.

The conference room was at the end of the hall. Morrison had clearly been preparing for their arrival. A whiteboard on the wall showed a timeline of Palmer's last day. A table held stacks of folders organized by category: financials, witness statements, surveillance footage, autopsy reports. A large evidence board displayed photos of the crime scene, the victim, and the mysterious Steven.

"Coffee?" Morrison asked, gesturing to a pot in the corner.

"Please," Matt said.

Morrison poured three cups while Matt and Brandon surveyed the room. Brandon's eyes went to the crime scene photos first—the bathroom, the tub, the victim. Even in photos, he could see the meticulous staging.

Morrison handed them coffee and sat down at the head of the table. Matt and Brandon took seats across from each other, notebooks out.

"All right," Morrison said. "Let me walk you through what we know, what we don't know, and where I've hit walls."

She pulled over a folder and opened it. "Michael Palmer, forty-two, real estate agent. Married, no kids, successful business. On January ninth, he met a potential buyer at Oak View Mall at eleven-thirty AM. The buyer's name was Steven—no last name given. They drove to a property in West Omaha for a showing. The homeowner, Karen Whitmore, left at noon to give them space. When she returned at one-fifteen PM, she found Palmer's body in the upstairs bathroom."

Morrison pulled out crime scene photos and spread them across the table. "Nineteen stab wounds, mostly to the torso. Medical examiner says the first three were immediately fatal. The rest were—" she paused, searching for the right word, "—thorough. Time of death is estimated between twelve-fifteen and twelve-forty-five PM."

"Narrow window," Matt said, making notes.

"Very. Which means Steven worked fast." Morrison pointed to another photo showing the victim in the tub. "The body was staged. Placed in the bathtub, shower turned on. The drain was plugged with a washcloth—we found it when we processed the scene. Water was running when Whitmore arrived, had been for probably thirty to forty-five minutes."

"Why plug the drain?" Brandon asked.

"We think to ensure the water covered the body completely. Dilute the blood, wash away trace evidence, complicate forensics." Morrison pulled out the forensics report. "It worked, to an extent. We found minimal DNA—just Palmer's. Some partial shoe prints in the bathroom that didn't match Palmer's shoes, but they're generic patterns. Could be from any sporting goods store."

"What about the stolen items?" Matt asked.

"Rolex Submariner, worth approximately eight thousand. Wedding band, white gold, maybe two thousand. Both taken from the body. But his wallet was in his car, untouched. Three hundred forty-seven dollars cash, credit cards, ID—all there."

"So not robbery," Brandon said.

"Right. Which brings us to motive." Morrison leaned back in her chair. "That's where everything falls apart. Palmer had no enemies. No one who'd want him dead. We've interviewed his wife, his business partner, his clients, his golf buddies, his barber. Everyone says the same thing: nice guy, successful, stable, boring."

"What about his business?" Matt asked. "Any deals gone bad? Angry clients? Disputed commissions?"

"We went through every transaction for the past five years. Nothing. A few unhappy clients here and there—someone didn't get the house they wanted, someone thought their place should have sold for more—but nothing that would escalate to murder. And certainly nothing that would result in a professional hit."

"Tell us about Steven," Brandon said.

Morrison pulled over another folder. "White male, fifties, five-eleven, medium build. Dark coat, wool or similar. Walked with a pronounced limp, used a cane. Spoke with an East Coast accent—the Starbucks barista said it sounded like Boston or New York. Claimed to be relocating from Northern California."

She spread out security camera stills from the mall. "This is him arriving at eleven-twenty AM. See how he keeps his face angled away from cameras? That's not accidental. He knows where the cameras are."

Brandon studied the images. Steven's body language was relaxed, unhurried. The cane looked real enough—dark wood, silver handle, the kind of thing someone would actually use. But something about his posture suggested the limp might be exaggerated.

"The phone number he gave Palmer?" Matt asked.

"Burner. Purchased with cash at a Walmart in Council Bluffs three days before the murder. Used only to contact Palmer. Disconnected the day after the murder."

"What about the mall footage? Did you track where he went after meeting Palmer?"

"Lost him in the parking lot. Cameras don't cover that area well. We see him and Palmer walking toward the exit together, then nothing. Palmer's Lexus left the lot at eleven-forty-three AM, but we never see Steven arrive in his own vehicle."

"He might have parked off-site," Matt said. "Walked to the mall."

"That's our theory. We canvassed nearby businesses, checked their security cameras. Nothing."

Brandon looked at the timeline on the whiteboard. Palmer and Steven left the mall at 11:43 AM. They arrived at the Whitmore property around noon. Whitmore left at 12:00 PM. Palmer was killed sometime between 12:15 and 12:45 PM. Whitmore returned at 1:15 PM and found the body.

"What about Palmer's vehicle?" Brandon asked.

"Found abandoned at the Crossroads Shopping Center, about two miles from the crime scene. Wiped clean—no prints except Palmer's. The keys were in the ignition."

"And his cell phone?"

"Found in a dumpster behind a restaurant downtown. Also wiped clean. Same with his wallet and keys—found separately, different locations, all downtown."

"Steven was thorough," Matt said.

"Very. He planned this. Probably for weeks." Morrison pulled out another file. "We looked at similar cases. Found three that match the MO: Kansas City 2004, Charlotte 2007, Phoenix 2010. All real estate professionals killed during property showings. All unsolved."

"We saw those in ViCAP," Brandon said. "You think it's the same person?"

"I think it's possible. The planning, the staging, the lack of obvious motive—it all fits. But the methods vary enough that I can't be certain."

Matt leaned forward. "What's your theory? Why kill Mike Palmer?"

Morrison was quiet for a moment. "Honestly? I don't have one. Everything I know about homicide tells me there should be a motive. But I can't find it. Palmer wasn't involved in anything shady. No affairs, no gambling, no drugs, no debts. His business was legitimate. His marriage was solid. He was just—" She stopped, frustrated. "He was just a real estate agent doing his job."

"Which means the answer is buried somewhere you haven't looked yet," Brandon said.

"That's what I'm hoping you can help me find." Morrison stood and walked to the evidence board. "I've done everything I can think of. Background checks, financial analysis, client interviews, surveillance review. I've hit every angle. But two FBI agents with fresh eyes might see something I missed."

Matt and Brandon exchanged a look. Morrison wasn't defensive about calling them in. She wasn't protecting turf or making excuses. She was a professional who knew when a case needed more resources.

"We'll need to visit the crime scene," Brandon said.

"I figured. I've arranged access for tomorrow morning at nine AM. The property's been released, but Mrs. Whitmore said she'd meet us there."

"What about Palmer's wife? Can we talk to her?"

"I'll set it up. Jennifer Palmer has been incredibly cooperative. I think she wants answers as much as we do."

They spent the next hour going through the files in detail. Morrison walked them through her investigation step by step, showing them what she'd found and where she'd hit dead ends. Her work was meticulous—every lead followed, every witness interviewed, every piece of evidence documented.

By the time they finished, it was almost five PM. Morrison gathered the files and handed them to Matt.

"Copies for you. Everything I have." She looked between them. "I know federal agents coming in can feel like we couldn't do our job. But that's not how I see it. This case needs solving, and I don't care who solves it as long as Palmer's family gets answers."

"We're here to help, not take over," Matt said. "This is still your case."

"Appreciate that." Morrison checked her watch. "You probably want to get settled. There's a Hampton Inn about ten minutes from here. Most federal agents stay there when they're in town."

"Sounds good."

They walked back to the elevator together. In the lobby, Morrison shook their hands again.

"See you tomorrow morning. Nine AM at the crime scene."

"We'll be there," Brandon said.

Outside, the afternoon had turned colder. Brandon and Matt walked to their car in silence, both processing everything they'd just learned.

"What do you think?" Matt asked once they were inside.

Brandon looked back at the police headquarters. "I think Morrison's right. This case is impossible."

"But?"

"But impossible just means we haven't found the right angle yet."

Matt started the engine. "Tomorrow we'll see the scene. Maybe that'll help."

Brandon hoped so. Because right now, three weeks after Michael Palmer's murder, they had a professional killer who'd disappeared, a victim with no apparent enemies, and no motive for why any of this had happened.

Somewhere in Omaha, Steven was going about his life. Maybe planning his next job. Maybe already gone.

But he'd left something behind. He had to have. Everyone did.

Tomorrow, standing in that bathroom where Palmer had died, maybe Brandon would find it.
