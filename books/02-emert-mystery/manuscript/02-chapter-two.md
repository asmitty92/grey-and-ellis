# Chapter Two

**Friday, February 1, 2013**

Matt woke at six-thirty to his phone's alarm, the Hampton Inn room dark except for the glow of the clock. Brandon was already awake in the next room—Matt could hear the shower running through the thin wall. They'd reviewed Morrison's files until almost midnight, making notes, discussing angles, building their mental map of the case.

Now it was time to see where Michael Palmer had died.

Matt showered, dressed in his usual field work clothes—dark pants, button-down shirt, tie, jacket that could conceal his weapon. He packed his notebook, camera, and evidence kit, though Morrison's team had already processed the scene thoroughly. Sometimes you found things on a second look. Sometimes you just needed to understand the space.

He met Brandon in the lobby at seven-fifteen. Brandon looked tired but focused, carrying his messenger bag and a travel mug of coffee from the hotel's breakfast bar.

"Ready?" Matt asked.

"Yeah."

They drove through morning Omaha traffic, heading west toward the suburbs. The city had that early February look—snow piled gray along curbs, bare trees, the sky a flat winter white that promised nothing. Matt navigated using the GPS while Brandon studied crime scene photos on his laptop one more time.

"What are you looking for?" Matt asked.

"Patterns. Staging choices." Brandon zoomed in on a photo of the bathroom. "Why the washcloth to plug the drain? Why not something else?"

"It was there. Convenient."

"Maybe. Or maybe it was deliberate. Use something from the house, leave nothing foreign behind." Brandon closed the laptop. "Steven was careful about what he brought and what he left."

They arrived at the Whitmore property at eight-forty-five. Morrison's unmarked sedan was already parked in the driveway beside a silver Honda—probably Karen Whitmore's car. The house sat at the end of a cul-de-sac, surrounded by empty lots waiting for spring construction. The nearest occupied house was three lots away.

Perfect isolation for murder.

Matt parked behind Morrison's car and killed the engine. For a moment, they both sat looking at the house. Two-story, modern craftsman style, beige siding with dark brown trim. Well-maintained landscaping, now dormant for winter. A house that should have been someone's home but instead had become a crime scene.

"You okay?" Matt asked quietly.

Brandon nodded. "Yeah. Just... preparing."

Matt understood. Whatever Brandon experienced at crime scenes—whether it was genuine psychic ability or exceptional subconscious processing—it took a toll. Brandon had described it once as "opening yourself to trauma." Standing where violence had happened and letting yourself feel it.

They got out and walked to the front door. Morrison appeared before they could knock, holding the door open.

"Morning. Mrs. Whitmore is in the kitchen. I've explained you'll need to walk through the house and spend time upstairs."

"How's she holding up?" Matt asked as they entered.

"About as well as you'd expect. She's grateful we're still working the case, but being here is hard."

The foyer was exactly as it had appeared in photos—hardwood floors, modern chandelier, everything clean and staged like a model home. But knowing what had happened upstairs gave the space a different weight. Matt could see it in the way Morrison moved through the house, the way Brandon's eyes tracked every detail.

Karen Whitmore stood in the kitchen, hands wrapped around a coffee mug. Late fifties, brown hair streaked with gray, wearing jeans and a heavy sweater. She looked like she hadn't slept well in three weeks.

"Mrs. Whitmore, I'm Special Agent Matt Ellis, this is Special Agent Brandon Gray. Thank you for letting us access the property."

She nodded. "Detective Morrison said you might be able to find something. That you've solved cases like this before."

"We'll do everything we can," Matt said, keeping his voice professional but not making promises they might not keep.

"I just want to sell this place and move on." She set down her mug, hands shaking slightly. "But no one wants to buy a house where someone was murdered. I'm trapped here with—" She stopped, composing herself. "I'm sorry. That's not important. You need to work."

"It's important to you, and that's valid," Brandon said quietly. "We're sorry this happened in your home."

Whitmore looked at him with something like gratitude. "Thank you. That means more than you might think." She picked up her keys. "I'll wait outside. I can't—I can't be in here while you look at the bathroom."

"Of course," Morrison said.

They waited until Whitmore had left through the front door, her Honda pulling out of the driveway. Then Morrison turned to them.

"Where do you want to start?"

"The bathroom," Brandon said. "But first, walk us through the approach. How did they get in?"

Morrison led them through the house, recreating Palmer and Steven's movements. "Front door was unlocked when Whitmore left at noon—she was expecting them. They arrived around twelve-fifteen based on her timeline and the ME's estimate. Palmer would have let them in, walked Steven through the downstairs first. Standard showing procedure."

Matt looked around the living room. "And Steven would have been evaluating the space. Looking for escape routes, camera positions, whether anyone could see in from outside."

"Exactly. From here, you can't see into neighboring houses. The lots on either side are empty." Morrison pointed toward the back. "The backyard has privacy fencing. Total isolation."

They moved upstairs. The master bedroom was spacious, well-appointed, with an attached bathroom visible through an open door. Morrison stopped at the threshold.

"This is where it happened."

Matt stepped into the bathroom first. It was large—separate shower and soaking tub, double vanity, tile floor that looked expensive. Clean now, all evidence of blood and violence scrubbed away by professional cleaners. But the space itself told the story.

"Palmer was standing here," Morrison said, positioning herself near the vanity. "Steven was behind him, probably to the left based on wound angles. The first stab hit the subclavian artery—quick, efficient, immediately incapacitating."

Matt studied the floor, the walls, the angles. "Palmer wouldn't have had time to fight back. First wound drops him, the rest happen while he's already dying."

"Correct. Eighteen more wounds, all to the torso. Then Steven drags or carries the body to the tub." Morrison pointed. "Washcloth from the vanity used to plug the drain. Shower turned on. Steven leaves Palmer there and walks out."

Brandon had been standing in the doorway, not entering yet. Now he stepped inside, moving slowly, eyes unfocused in that way Matt had learned to recognize. Brandon was opening himself to whatever impressions the scene might give him.

Matt gave him space and focused on the physical evidence. The bathroom had two exits—the door to the bedroom, and a small window above the toilet that looked out over the backyard. Too small for escape, but Steven might have checked it anyway. Matt opened the window, looked out. No one could see in from this angle. No cameras, no witnesses.

Perfect privacy for murder.

"The shower was running when Whitmore found him," Matt said. "How long had it been on?"

"At least thirty to forty-five minutes based on the water temperature and amount in the tub," Morrison said. "The drain was plugged but not completely sealed—water was escaping slowly. If Steven had sealed it completely, the tub would have overflowed."

"So he wanted water covering the body but not flooding the bathroom. Deliberate choice."

"Looks that way."

Matt photographed the bathroom from multiple angles, documenting what the crime scene photos might have missed. The sight lines, the space between tub and vanity, the distance from door to shower. Steven would have needed room to maneuver. To drag or carry a dying man to the tub. To stage everything just right.

Brandon had moved to stand beside the tub. His hand hovered over the porcelain edge but didn't touch it. His breathing had slowed, gone quiet. Matt knew this process took time.

Morrison watched Brandon with open curiosity. "Is he—"

"Just let him work," Matt said quietly.

They waited. Matt continued his examination of the physical space while Brandon stood motionless beside the tub. Minutes passed. Morrison shifted her weight, uncomfortable with the silence but respecting it.

Finally, Brandon spoke. "He was confused."

Matt looked up. "Palmer?"

"Yes." Brandon's voice was distant, like he was describing something he was watching rather than remembering. "He didn't understand. Thought maybe there was some mistake. Some explanation. Even when Steven stabbed him, he was trying to make sense of it."

"Did he know Steven?" Morrison asked.

"No. That's what confused him. He knew this was about a property showing. Knew they were here to look at the house. Then Steven was behind him and—" Brandon stopped, hand dropping to his side. "It happened fast. The first wound. Everything went dark around the edges. Palmer tried to stay conscious but he couldn't. By the time Steven moved him to the tub, he was already dying."

Matt made notes. "Did Palmer say anything? Try to speak?"

"Maybe. I'm not sure. It's not clear." Brandon turned away from the tub, looking frustrated. "I can feel the confusion, the fear, but I can't see why. Palmer didn't know why this was happening to him."

"Because he didn't know Steven," Morrison said.

"Right. But more than that. He was confused about the whole situation. Like—" Brandon searched for words, "—like he thought this should be about something else. Does that make sense?"

Matt considered. "You're saying Palmer expected there to be a reason, but there wasn't one?"

"Or there was a reason Palmer didn't know about." Brandon looked around the bathroom one more time. "Steven knew exactly what he was doing. Palmer had no idea."

Morrison pulled out her notebook. "That matches what we found. Palmer had no defensive wounds, no signs he fought back or tried to run. The attack came from behind without warning."

Matt photographed the tub, the drain, the showerhead. Everything Steven had touched, arranged, controlled. "How long would this staging take? From first wound to leaving the scene?"

"Medical examiner estimates Palmer was unconscious within thirty seconds, dead within two to three minutes," Morrison said. "Add time for moving the body, plugging the drain, turning on the shower, cleaning up—maybe ten minutes total?"

"And Steven walked out like nothing had happened," Matt said. "Down the stairs, out the front door, into Palmer's Lexus. Drove to Oak Park Center, switched vehicles, disappeared."

Brandon was standing in the doorway now, looking back at the bathroom. "Steven's done this before. He knew exactly how long each step would take. How to move efficiently. What to touch and what to avoid."

"The other cases in ViCAP," Matt said. "Kansas City, Charlotte, Phoenix. Different methods but similar execution. Same level of planning."

Morrison nodded. "I've requested full files on those cases. Should have them early next week."

They spent another thirty minutes in the bathroom, then moved through the rest of the house. Brandon checked each room, looking for anything Steven might have touched or observed. Matt photographed sight lines, entrances, exits. Morrison pointed out details from the initial investigation—where they'd found fingerprints (only Palmer's and Whitmore's), where they'd collected trace evidence (minimal), what they'd eliminated.

By the time they finished, it was nearly eleven AM. They walked out to find Karen Whitmore sitting in her Honda, engine running for heat. She got out when she saw them.

"Did you find anything?" she asked, hope and resignation mixing in her voice.

"We're building our understanding of what happened," Matt said carefully. "Your cooperation is helping."

"Will you catch him? The man who did this?"

Matt met her eyes. "We're going to try very hard, Mrs. Whitmore."

She nodded, accepting that non-answer. "When you do, will you let me know? I just—I need to know he's not out there anymore."

"We will," Morrison said.

They watched Whitmore drive away, then stood in the cold morning air looking at the house.

"Impressions?" Morrison asked.

Brandon was quiet for a moment. "Palmer's confusion bothers me. He didn't just not know Steven—he was confused about why any of this was happening. Like it didn't make sense to him at all."

"What if it wasn't supposed to happen to him?" Matt said slowly, the thought forming as he spoke. "What if Steven had the wrong target?"

Morrison looked at him. "Mistaken identity?"

"It's a theory. Would explain the lack of motive. Palmer was clean because he wasn't supposed to be the victim." Matt pulled out his notebook, flipping to a fresh page. "We should look at other real estate agents in the area. Similar age, appearance, name. Anyone who might fit Palmer's profile but had reasons to be targeted."

Brandon nodded slowly. "That could explain his confusion. He was trying to understand why someone would kill him, and there was no reason—because it wasn't supposed to be him."

Morrison looked skeptical but not dismissive. "It's possible. I can pull lists of agents working this area. Cross-reference with anyone who might have enemies, debts, dangerous associations."

"Let's pursue it," Matt said. "Even if we're wrong, it's an angle worth exploring."

They drove back toward downtown, Morrison leading in her sedan, Matt and Brandon following. In the car, Matt replayed the scene in his head. The bathroom, the tub, the careful staging. Steven's methodical approach. Palmer's confusion.

"What do you really think?" Brandon asked. "About the mistaken identity theory?"

Matt was quiet for a moment. "I think we need to follow every lead. But I also think—" He paused. "I think if Steven is as professional as he seems, he wouldn't make that kind of mistake. Getting the wrong target doesn't fit with someone who plans this carefully."

"So you don't believe it?"

"I'm not sure yet. But we'll work the theory anyway. Sometimes you have to go down the wrong path to find the right one."

Brandon looked out the window at Omaha passing by. "Palmer's confusion was real. He genuinely didn't understand why this was happening to him."

"Then we find out why," Matt said. "Even if Palmer didn't know, someone did. Steven knew. And somewhere in Palmer's life, there's a connection we haven't found yet."

They pulled into the police station parking lot behind Morrison. Inside, they'd start building their investigation—lists, interviews, backgrounds, financial records. The methodical work that solved cases when psychic impressions and crime scene visits weren't enough.

Matt grabbed his notebook and got out of the car. Brandon followed, both of them heading inside to begin the real work.

Somewhere in Omaha, Steven was going about his day. Maybe watching news coverage of the investigation. Maybe already planning his next job. But he'd left something behind—a pattern, a mistake, a connection.

They just had to find it.
