# Chapter Two

**Friday, February 1, 2013**

Matt woke at six-thirty to his phone's alarm, the Hampton Inn room dark except for the glow of the clock. Brandon was already awake in the next room—Matt could hear the shower running through the thin wall. They'd reviewed Morrison's files until almost midnight, making notes, discussing angles, building their mental map of the case.

Now it was time to see where Michael Palmer had died.

Matt showered and dressed—dark slacks, button-down shirt, his service weapon in a belt holster. He packed his notebook, camera, and evidence kit, though Morrison's team had already processed the scene thoroughly. Sometimes you found things on a second look. Sometimes you just needed to understand the space.

He met Brandon in the lobby at seven-fifteen. Brandon looked tired but focused, carrying his messenger bag and a travel mug of coffee from the hotel's breakfast bar. They grabbed pastries from the continental breakfast—neither of them was particularly hungry, but experience had taught them to eat when they could.

"How'd you sleep?" Matt asked as they walked to the car.

"Couple hours." Brandon settled into the passenger seat. "You?"

"Five or six. Not bad."

They drove through morning Omaha traffic, heading west toward the suburbs. The city had that early February look—snow piled gray along curbs, bare trees, the sky a flat winter white that promised nothing. Matt navigated using the GPS while Brandon studied crime scene photos on his laptop.

"What are you looking for?" Matt asked.

"Staging choices." Brandon zoomed in on a photo of the bathroom. "Why the washcloth to plug the drain? Why not something else?"

"It was there. Convenient."

"Maybe. Or maybe it was deliberate. Use something from the house, leave nothing foreign behind." Brandon pulled up another photo showing the victim's position in the tub. "Look at how Palmer's arms are positioned. At his sides, not defensive. Not grasping or reaching. Like he was placed that way."

Matt glanced at the laptop screen. "Steven arranged him after death."

"Right. But why? Just to fit in the tub? Or because it meant something?"

They arrived at the Whitmore property at eight-forty-five. Morrison's unmarked sedan was already parked in the driveway beside a silver Honda. The house sat at the end of a cul-de-sac, surrounded by empty lots waiting for spring construction. The nearest occupied house was three lots away, maybe two hundred yards. Far enough that screams wouldn't carry. Far enough that no one would notice a car leaving in the middle of the day.

Perfect isolation for murder.

Matt pulled in behind Morrison's car and killed the engine. For a moment, they both sat looking at the house. Two-story, modern craftsman style, beige siding with dark brown trim. A house that should have been someone's home but instead had become a crime scene.

"You okay?" Matt asked quietly.

Brandon nodded. "Yeah. Just preparing."

Matt understood. Whatever Brandon experienced at crime scenes—whether it was genuine psychic ability or exceptional subconscious processing—it took a toll. Brandon had described it once as "opening yourself to trauma." Standing where violence had happened and letting yourself feel it.

They got out and walked to the front door. Morrison appeared before they could knock, holding the door open.

"Morning. Mrs. Whitmore is in the kitchen. I've explained you'll need to walk through the house and spend time upstairs."

"How's she holding up?" Matt asked as they entered.

"About as well as you'd expect."

Karen Whitmore stood in the kitchen, hands wrapped around a coffee mug. Late fifties, brown hair streaked with gray, wearing jeans and a heavy sweater. She looked like she hadn't slept well in three weeks.

"Mrs. Whitmore, I'm Special Agent Matt Ellis, this is Special Agent Brandon Gray. Thank you for letting us access your home."

She nodded. "Detective Morrison said you might be able to find something. That you've solved cases like this before."

"We'll do everything we can," Matt said.

"I just want to sell this place and move on." She set down her mug, hands shaking slightly. "But no one wants to buy a house where someone was murdered. And now I'm trapped here with—" She stopped, composing herself. "I'm sorry. Those details don't interest you. You need to work."

"It's important to you, and that's valid," Brandon said quietly. "We're sorry this happened in your home."

Whitmore looked at him with something like gratitude. "Thank you." She picked up her keys. "I'll wait outside. I can't be in here while you look at the bathroom."

"Of course," Morrison said. "Take your time."

They waited until Whitmore had stepped out to the front porch, pulling her coat tight against the cold. Then Morrison turned to them.

"Where do you want to start?"

"Upstairs," Matt said. "The bathroom."

Morrison led them through the foyer and up the stairs. Matt noted the sight lines as they climbed—anyone in the upstairs hallway would be invisible from the street, from neighboring lots, from anywhere. Steven had chosen well.

The master bedroom was at the end of the hall. Morrison stopped at the threshold.

"This is where it happened."

Matt stepped inside. The bedroom was spacious—king bed against one wall, walk-in closet, the attached bathroom visible through an open door. The carpet looked new. The walls had been repainted. But the layout remained the same.

"Where exactly?" Matt asked.

Morrison walked to the bathroom doorway. "Based on blood spatter and the ME's analysis, Palmer was standing just inside the bathroom. Steven was behind him and to the left. The angle of the first wound suggests Steven was slightly taller or Palmer was already turning when the knife came up."

Matt stepped into the bathroom. High-end fixtures—marble countertops on the double vanity, large soaking tub with an integrated rainfall showerhead above it, glass partition on one side. The kind of tub-shower combination you'd find in an upscale hotel. Clean now, all evidence of blood and violence scrubbed away by professional cleaners.

"Walk me through the sequence," Matt said.

Morrison consulted her notebook. "First wound severs the subclavian artery. Palmer has maybe thirty to forty-five seconds of consciousness, but he's in shock, losing blood pressure fast. Eighteen more wounds follow—all to the torso. Then Steven moves the body to the tub, plugs the drain with a washcloth from the vanity, turns on the water."

"The water was running when Whitmore found him?"

"Yes. Drain was partially plugged—water escaping slowly, keeping the level stable without overflowing."

Matt examined the tub, then the vanity. Double sinks, plenty of counter space, drawers underneath. "The washcloth came from here?"

"Bottom drawer, right side."

Matt photographed the drawer, then moved back to the tub. He crouched down, studying the drain. "Steven plugs the drain first, then positions the body, then turns on the water. That's the only sequence that makes sense."

"That's our reconstruction," Morrison agreed.

Brandon had been standing in the doorway, studying the space. Now he spoke. "Can I have a few minutes alone in here?"

Morrison glanced at Matt.

"Brandon likes to reconstruct the scene in his head," Matt said. "Works better without distractions."

"Sure." Morrison stepped back. "We'll be in the hallway."

Matt followed her out, pulling the door mostly closed behind them. They stood in the master bedroom, Morrison checking her phone, Matt making notes.

"He does this often?" Morrison asked. "The reconstruction thing?"

"It's his process. Sometimes he picks up on details we miss."

They waited. Matt could hear Brandon moving slowly around the bathroom—footsteps on tile, occasional pauses. Ten minutes passed. Fifteen.

Finally, the door opened and Brandon stepped out. He looked tired, but his eyes were focused.

"Anything?" Matt asked.

"Some thoughts. Let's finish the walkthrough first."

They moved through the rest of the house quickly—the other bedrooms, the first floor, the garage. Matt photographed sight lines and exits while Morrison pointed out where her team had collected evidence. Brandon was quiet, processing.

By the time they finished, it was nearly eleven. They walked out to find Karen Whitmore sitting on the porch steps, arms wrapped around herself against the cold.

"Did you find anything?" she asked.

"We're building our understanding of what happened," Matt said carefully. "Your cooperation is helping."

She nodded and went back inside without another word. They walked to their cars, breath fogging in the cold air.

"All right," Morrison said. "What are you thinking?"

Brandon spoke first. "The staging was methodical. Steven killed Palmer near the bathroom entrance, then moved him to the tub. He positioned the body carefully—arms at sides, legs straight. Not rushed. He plugged the drain, turned on the water, checked that everything was right. Then he left the way he came."

"That matches our reconstruction," Morrison said.

"What doesn't match," Brandon continued, "is motive. You said Palmer was clean. No enemies, no secrets, no reason anyone would want him dead."

"That's what three weeks of investigation tells us."

"What if Palmer wasn't the target?"

Morrison frowned. "Mistaken identity?"

"It's a theory," Matt said. "Would explain the lack of motive. Palmer was clean because he wasn't supposed to be the victim."

"Michael Palmer. Mike Palmer." Brandon shrugged. "Common enough name. If Steven was working from limited information—a name, a profession, a general description—he might have picked the wrong agent."

Morrison crossed her arms. "Would a professional make that kind of mistake? Someone this careful?"

"Depends on how he got his information," Matt said. "If someone hired him and gave him bad intel, if there were multiple agents matching the description—"

"It's worth checking," Brandon said. "Pull a list of male real estate agents in the Omaha area, age thirty-five to fifty. Look for similar names, similar profiles. Anyone who might have enemies."

Morrison considered. "That's a decent-sized list. But I can narrow it down." She pulled out her phone, making a note. "I'll have something by Monday."

"What about Jennifer Palmer?" Matt asked. "Can we talk to her tomorrow?"

"I'll set it up."

They agreed to reconvene Monday morning at the station. Morrison drove off, leaving Matt and Brandon in the parking lot.

In the car, Brandon was quiet as Matt pulled onto the street. They drove for a few minutes before Matt spoke.

"What did you actually get in there?"

Brandon stared out the window. "Palmer was confused. Not just scared—confused. Like he was trying to understand why this was happening and there was no answer."

"Because he didn't know Steven."

"More than that. He was looking for context—an affair discovered, a deal gone bad, something that would explain it. And there was nothing. It just didn't make sense to him."

Matt processed that. "Which supports mistaken identity. He couldn't find a reason because there wasn't one. At least not one connected to him."

"Maybe." Brandon rubbed his eyes. "There's something else. Palmer saw Steven's face right before the first wound. There was something distinctive about him, something Palmer noticed. But I can't get it clearly."

"The scar? The witnesses mentioned a facial scar."

"Could be. The impression is scattered. Palmer's confusion is overwhelming everything else."

They drove in silence for a while. Matt turned onto the highway, heading back toward downtown.

"Do you actually believe the mistaken identity theory?" Brandon asked.

Matt considered. "I think it's worth pursuing. But someone as professional as Steven—the mall surveillance evasion, the isolated property, the staging—that's not someone who makes careless mistakes."

"So either he got bad information from whoever hired him..."

"Or Palmer was the right target and the motive is buried deeper than three weeks of investigation could find." Matt glanced at Brandon. "Either way, we keep digging. We talk to the wife tomorrow, see if there's something in Palmer's past that didn't show up in the initial background."

Brandon nodded slowly. "And if there's nothing?"

"Then we work the mistaken identity angle harder. Find out who should have been in that bathroom instead of Mike Palmer."

They pulled into the hotel parking lot. The afternoon stretched ahead—time to review files, make notes, prepare for tomorrow's interview. Matt killed the engine but didn't move to get out.

"You okay?" he asked.

"Yeah." Brandon opened his door. "Just thinking about Palmer. Dying confused, not understanding why. That's a hard way to go."

"We'll find out why. That's what we do."

Brandon nodded and stepped out into the cold. Matt followed, both of them heading inside to continue the work.

The answer was out there somewhere. In Palmer's past, in Steven's pattern, in the connections they hadn't found yet.

They just had to keep looking.
