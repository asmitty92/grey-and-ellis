# Chapter Two

**Friday, February 1, 2013**

Matt woke at six-thirty to his phone's alarm, the Hampton Inn room dark except for the glow of the clock. Brandon was already awake in the next room—Matt could hear the shower running through the thin wall. They'd reviewed Morrison's files until almost midnight, making notes, discussing angles, building their mental map of the case.

Now it was time to see where Michael Palmer had died.

Matt showered and dressed—dark slacks, button-down shirt, his service weapon in a belt holster. He packed his notebook, camera, and evidence kit, though Morrison's team had already processed the scene thoroughly. Sometimes you found things on a second look. Sometimes you just needed to understand the space.

He met Brandon in the lobby at seven-fifteen. Brandon looked tired but focused, carrying his messenger bag and a travel mug of coffee from the hotel's breakfast bar. They grabbed pastries from the continental breakfast—neither of them was particularly hungry, but experience had taught them to eat when they could.

"How'd you sleep?" Matt asked as they walked to the car.

"Couple hours." Brandon settled into the passenger seat. "You?"

"Five or six. Not bad."

They drove through morning Omaha traffic, heading west toward the suburbs. The city had that early February look—snow piled gray along curbs, bare trees, the sky a flat winter white that promised nothing. Matt navigated using the GPS while Brandon studied crime scene photos on his laptop.

"What are you looking for?" Matt asked.

"Staging choices." Brandon zoomed in on a photo of the bathroom. "Why the washcloth to plug the drain? Why not something else?"

"It was there. Convenient."

"Maybe. Or maybe it was deliberate. Use something from the house, leave nothing foreign behind." Brandon pulled up another photo showing the victim's position in the tub. "Look at how Palmer's arms are positioned. At his sides, not defensive. Not grasping or reaching. Like he was placed that way."

Matt glanced at the laptop screen. "Steven arranged him after death."

"Right. But why? Just to fit in the tub? Or because it meant something?"

They arrived at the Whitmore property at eight-forty-five. Morrison's unmarked sedan was already parked in the driveway beside a silver Honda. The house sat at the end of a cul-de-sac, surrounded by empty lots waiting for spring construction. The nearest occupied house was three lots away, maybe two hundred yards. Far enough that screams wouldn't carry. Far enough that no one would notice a car leaving in the middle of the day.

Perfect isolation for murder.

Matt pulled in behind Morrison's car and killed the engine. For a moment, they both sat looking at the house. Two-story, modern craftsman style, beige siding with dark brown trim. A house that should have been someone's home but instead had become a crime scene.

"You okay?" Matt asked quietly.

Brandon nodded. "Yeah. Just preparing."

Matt understood. Whatever Brandon experienced at crime scenes—whether it was genuine psychic ability or exceptional subconscious processing—it took a toll. Brandon had described it once as "opening yourself to trauma." Standing where violence had happened and letting yourself feel it.

They got out and walked to the front door. Morrison appeared before they could knock, holding the door open.

"Morning. Mrs. Whitmore is in the kitchen. I've explained you'll need to walk through the house and spend time upstairs."

"How's she holding up?" Matt asked as they entered.

"About as well as you'd expect."

Karen Whitmore stood in the kitchen, hands wrapped around a coffee mug. Late fifties, brown hair streaked with gray, wearing jeans and a heavy sweater. She looked like she hadn't slept well in three weeks.

"Mrs. Whitmore, I'm Special Agent Matt Ellis, this is Special Agent Brandon Gray. Thank you for letting us access your home."

She nodded. "Detective Morrison said you might be able to find something. That you've solved cases like this before."

"We'll do everything we can," Matt said.

"I just want to sell this place and move on." She set down her mug, hands shaking slightly. "But no one wants to buy a house where someone was murdered. And now I'm trapped here with—" She stopped, composing herself. "I'm sorry, I'm rambling. You need to work."

"It's important to you, and that's valid," Brandon said quietly. "We're sorry this happened in your home."

Whitmore looked at him with something like gratitude. "Thank you." She picked up her keys. "I'll wait outside. I can't be in here while you look at the bathroom."

"Of course," Morrison said. "Take your time."

They waited until Whitmore had stepped out to the front porch, pulling her coat tight against the cold. Then Morrison turned to them.

"Where do you want to start?"

"Upstairs," Matt said. "The bathroom."

Morrison led them through the foyer and up the stairs. Matt noted the sight lines as they climbed—anyone in the upstairs hallway would be invisible from the street, from neighboring lots, from anywhere. Steven had chosen well.

The master bedroom was at the end of the hall. Morrison stopped at the threshold.

"This is where it happened."

Matt stepped inside. The bedroom was spacious—king bed against one wall, walk-in closet, the attached bathroom visible through an open door. The carpet looked new. The walls had been repainted. But the layout remained the same.

"Where exactly?" Matt asked.

Morrison walked to the bathroom doorway. "Based on blood spatter and the ME's analysis, Palmer was standing just inside the bathroom. Steven was behind him and to the left. The angle of the first wound suggests Steven was slightly taller or Palmer was already turning when the knife came up."

Matt stepped into the bathroom. High-end fixtures—marble countertops on the double vanity, large soaking tub with an integrated rainfall showerhead above it, glass partition on one side. The kind of tub-shower combination you'd find in an upscale hotel. Clean now, all evidence of blood and violence scrubbed away by professional cleaners.

"Walk me through the sequence," Matt said.

Morrison consulted her notebook. "First wound severs the subclavian artery. Palmer has maybe thirty to forty-five seconds of consciousness, but he's in shock, losing blood pressure fast. Eighteen more wounds follow—all to the torso. Then Steven moves the body to the tub, plugs the drain with a washcloth from the vanity, turns on the water."

"The water was running when Whitmore found him?"

"Yes. Drain was partially plugged—water escaping slowly, keeping the level stable without overflowing."

Matt examined the tub, then the vanity. Double sinks, plenty of counter space, drawers underneath. "The washcloth came from here?"

"Bottom drawer, right side."

Matt photographed the drawer, then moved back to the tub. He crouched down, studying the drain. "Steven plugs the drain first, then positions the body, then turns on the water. That's the only sequence that makes sense."

"That's our reconstruction," Morrison agreed.

Brandon had been standing in the doorway, studying the space. Now he spoke. "Can I have a few minutes alone in here?"

Morrison glanced at Matt.

"Brandon likes to reconstruct the scene in his head," Matt said. "Works better without distractions."

"Sure." Morrison stepped back. "We'll be in the hallway."

Matt followed her out, pulling the door mostly closed behind them. They stood in the master bedroom, Morrison checking her phone, Matt making notes.

"He does this often?" Morrison asked. "The reconstruction thing?"

"It's his process. Sometimes he picks up on details we miss."

They waited. Matt could hear Brandon moving slowly around the bathroom—footsteps on tile, occasional pauses. Ten minutes passed. Fifteen.

Finally, the door opened and Brandon stepped out. He looked tired, but his eyes were focused.

"Anything?" Matt asked.

"Some thoughts. Let's finish the walkthrough first."

They moved through the rest of the house quickly—the other bedrooms, the first floor, the garage. Matt photographed sight lines and exits while Morrison pointed out where her team had collected evidence. Brandon was quiet, processing.

By the time they finished, it was nearly eleven. They walked out to find Karen Whitmore sitting on the porch steps, arms wrapped around herself against the cold.

"Did you find anything?" she asked.

"We're building our understanding of what happened," Matt said carefully. "Your cooperation is helping."

She nodded and went back inside without another word. They walked to their cars, breath fogging in the cold air.

"All right," Morrison said. "What are you thinking?"

Brandon spoke first. "The staging was methodical. Steven killed Palmer near the bathroom entrance, then moved him to the tub. He positioned the body carefully—arms at sides, legs straight. Not rushed. He plugged the drain, turned on the water, checked that everything was right. Then he left the way he came."

"That matches our reconstruction," Morrison said.

"What doesn't match," Brandon continued, "is motive. You said Palmer was clean. No enemies, no secrets, no reason anyone would want him dead."

"That's what three weeks of investigation tells us."

"What if Palmer wasn't the target?"

Morrison frowned. "Mistaken identity?"

"It's a theory," Matt said. "Would explain the lack of motive. Palmer was clean because he wasn't supposed to be the victim."

"Michael Palmer. Mike Palmer." Brandon shrugged. "Common enough name. If Steven was working from limited information—a name, a profession, a general description—he might have picked the wrong agent."

Morrison crossed her arms. "Would a professional make that kind of mistake? Someone this careful?"

"Depends on how he got his information," Matt said. "If someone hired him and gave him bad intel, if there were multiple agents matching the description—"

"It's worth checking," Brandon said. "Pull a list of male real estate agents in the Omaha area, age thirty-five to fifty. Look for similar names, similar profiles. Anyone who might have enemies."

Morrison considered. "That's a decent-sized list. But I can narrow it down." She pulled out her phone, making a note. "I'll have something by Monday. What about Jennifer Palmer? You'll want to talk to her."

"Today if possible," Matt said.

Morrison checked her watch. "I'll call her, see if she's available this afternoon."

---

Jennifer Palmer lived in a two-story colonial in Rockbrook Village, a quiet neighborhood about fifteen minutes from downtown. Morrison had called ahead—Mrs. Palmer was home and willing to talk.

They parked on the street at two-fifteen. The house was well-maintained, tasteful landscaping dormant for winter, a Volvo SUV in the driveway. The kind of house that said comfortable without shouting wealthy.

Morrison rang the bell. A moment later, the door opened.

Jennifer Palmer was in her early forties, blonde hair pulled back, wearing slacks and a cream-colored sweater. She had the look of someone who'd been crying regularly and had gotten used to hiding it.

"Detective Morrison. Please, come in."

They followed her into a living room decorated in neutral tones—beige couch, cream carpet, family photos on the mantle. Matt noted one of the photos: Mike and Jennifer Palmer on what looked like a vacation, palm trees in the background, both of them smiling. A snapshot of a life that no longer existed.

"Can I get you anything? Coffee, water?"
>NITPICK: We ask this coffee, water? question a lot.

"We're fine, thank you," Matt said. "Mrs. Palmer, I'm Special Agent Matt Ellis, this is Special Agent Brandon Gray. We appreciate you taking the time to speak with us."

"Of course." She sat in an armchair across from the couch, hands folded in her lap. "Detective Morrison said you specialize in difficult cases. That you might see something her team missed."

"We're approaching it with fresh eyes," Matt said. "Sometimes that helps."

Morrison took a seat near the window, notepad out. Matt and Brandon sat on the couch.

"Mrs. Palmer, I know you've answered a lot of questions already," Matt began. "Some of what I ask might cover the same ground. I apologize for the repetition."

"It's fine. I want to help. I want—" Her voice caught slightly. "I want to know who did this to Mike."

Matt opened his notebook. "Tell me about your husband. What was he like?"

Jennifer took a breath. "Mike was... steady. Reliable. He loved his work—loved helping people find homes. He used to say that selling houses wasn't really about property, it was about matching families to places where they'd make memories." She smiled faintly. "He could be corny like that."

"How long were you married?"

"Eighteen years in October. Would have been." The correction seemed to cost her something. "We met at a real estate conference in Kansas City. I was just getting my license, he'd been in the business a few years. He asked me to dinner, and—that was it."

"Any children?"

"No. We tried, early on. It didn't work out. After a while, we made peace with it. We had the business, each other. It was enough."

Matt made notes. "Tell me about the business. Palmer-Rodriguez Real Estate."

"We started it ten years ago—Mike, me, and David Rodriguez. David handles commercial properties, Mike did residential, I do a mix of both. We're not the biggest firm in Omaha, but we have a good reputation. Steady clients, good referrals."

"Any problems at work? Disputes with clients, issues with competitors?"

Jennifer shook her head. "Nothing serious. Real estate has its share of unhappy customers—deals fall through, people don't get the price they wanted. But nothing that would—" She stopped. "Nothing like this."

"What about David Rodriguez? How was Mike's relationship with him?"

"They were friends. Good friends. David's been devastated by this. He was at the funeral, helped me with arrangements, called every day for the first two weeks." Her expression softened. "David's not capable of hurting anyone. I know the spouse and business partner are usually suspects, but—David's a good man."

Matt noted her defense of Rodriguez. Not unusual for someone who'd worked closely with both men for a decade. "What about Mike's life outside work? Hobbies, friends, activities?"

"Golf, mostly. He played at Oak Hills Country Club, usually on weekends. Had a regular foursome—Jim Hartley, Bob Chen, Steve Martinez. They've all been checked, Detective Morrison told me."

"Any other interests? Clubs, organizations?"

"He volunteered with Habitat for Humanity a few times a year. We both did. And he was on the board of the Omaha Chamber of Commerce, but that was more of a networking thing." She paused. "Mike wasn't complicated. He worked, played golf, watched football on Sundays. We traveled when we could—usually somewhere warm in February. This year we were planning Costa Rica."

Matt let a moment pass. "Mrs. Palmer, I have to ask some more personal questions. I apologize in advance."

"I understand."

"Was there anyone in Mike's past who might have held a grudge? An ex-girlfriend, a former colleague, someone from before you knew him?"

Jennifer considered. "Mike dated before we met, but nothing serious. There was a woman named Laura something—they were together for a year in his twenties. She got married, moved to Colorado. I can't imagine she'd—"

"Anyone else?"

"Not that I know of. Mike wasn't the type to make enemies. He could be stubborn sometimes, but he was fair. People liked him."

Brandon spoke for the first time. "What about before real estate? What did Mike do in his twenties?"

Jennifer looked at him. "He worked at his father's insurance agency for a few years after college. Hated it. That's why he got into real estate—wanted to do something different, build something of his own."

"Where did he go to college?"

"Creighton. Business degree. He was in a fraternity—Sigma Chi, I think. But he wasn't really the fraternity type. He joined for networking, stayed for a year, then focused on his studies."

Matt made a note. College years, fraternity, father's business. Nothing that screamed motive, but they'd check anyway.

"Mrs. Palmer," Matt said, "we're exploring a theory. It's possible—and I want to stress this is just a possibility—that Mike wasn't the intended target. That whoever did this may have mistaken him for someone else."

Jennifer stared at him. "Mistaken him? For who?"

"We don't know yet. We're looking into other real estate agents in the area with similar profiles. It's one angle we're pursuing."

"You're saying Mike might have died for—for nothing? A mistake?"

"We don't know. But if it's true, it would explain why we haven't found a motive connected to Mike specifically."

Jennifer sat very still. Matt watched her process it—the possibility that her husband's death was random, meaningless, a case of wrong place wrong time. He couldn't tell if that would make it easier or harder to bear.

"I don't know what to do with that," she said finally. "I've spent three weeks trying to understand why someone would want to kill Mike. And now you're telling me maybe no one did. Not him specifically."

"It's just a theory," Brandon said quietly. "We're still investigating all possibilities."

Jennifer looked at the photo on the mantle—the vacation shot, the palm trees, the smiles. "Is there anything else?"

Matt had more questions, but he could see she was fading. They'd gotten what they could for now. "That's all for today. We may have follow-up questions as the investigation progresses."

"Of course. Whatever you need."

Morrison stood, tucking away her notepad. "I'll keep you updated, Jennifer. Anything new, you'll know."

"Thank you."

They left Jennifer Palmer standing in her living room, arms crossed, staring at photographs of a life that had ended three weeks ago.

---

Outside, the afternoon had turned colder. They stood beside their cars, Morrison's breath fogging as she spoke.

"She told us the same thing she told me two weeks ago. Mike Palmer was a good man with no enemies."

"Which either means she's right," Matt said, "or the enemy was hidden well enough that even his wife didn't know."

Morrison nodded. "I'll start on that list of agents. Cross-reference names, physical profiles, anyone with complaints or legal issues. Should have something by Monday."

"We'll dig into Palmer's background," Brandon said. "College years, early career, the insurance agency. Maybe there's something from before Jennifer knew him."

They agreed to touch base over the weekend if anything surfaced. Morrison drove off, and Matt and Brandon got into their rental.

"What do you think?" Matt asked as he started the engine.

Brandon was quiet for a moment. "She's telling the truth. At least, what she believes is the truth. Mike Palmer was exactly who he appeared to be."

"Then we're back to mistaken identity. Or something buried so deep even his wife couldn't see it."

"Or both," Brandon said. "The motive could be from before they met. Something from his twenties that never came up because it was over and done with."

Matt pulled onto the street. "We'll check the fraternity, the insurance agency, the ex-girlfriend in Colorado. See if anything shakes loose."

"And if nothing does?"

"Then we work Morrison's list. Find out who should have been in that bathroom instead of Mike Palmer."

They drove back to the hotel in silence. The case was taking shape—not answers yet, but at least the right questions. Palmer's confusion, the professional execution, the missing motive. Somewhere in the gap between those things was the truth.

They just had to find it.
