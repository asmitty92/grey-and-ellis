# Chapter Three

**Saturday, February 2, 2013**

Brandon woke to gray light filtering through the Hampton Inn curtains. His phone said seven-fifteen—later than usual, but he'd been up past two reviewing Morrison's case files again, looking for something they'd missed.

Matt was still asleep in the next room. They'd agreed to work separately over the weekend—Matt would follow up on some local angles, Brandon would dig into Palmer's background. Morrison's list of similar-named agents wouldn't be ready until Monday, which left the mistaken identity theory in limbo for now.

Brandon showered, dressed, and headed down to the breakfast bar. He filled a travel mug with coffee, grabbed a bagel he wouldn't eat, and returned to his room. His laptop was already open on the desk, tabs from last night still loaded. He settled into the chair and started working.

First: Creighton University.

Palmer had graduated in 1992 with a business degree. Twenty-one years ago. Brandon pulled up the university website, navigated to alumni services, found the registrar contact information. He'd need official records, but those would take time and probably require a warrant. For now, he'd work with what was publicly available.

He searched for "Michael Palmer Creighton University" and found a few hits. An alumni directory listing from 2010. A mention in a business school newsletter about Palmer-Rodriguez Real Estate's tenth anniversary. Nothing substantial.

Brandon tried a different approach. He pulled up LinkedIn, searched for Creighton graduates from 1988-1992. Filtered by business degree. Got several hundred results. Too many to sort through manually, but he started scanning names, looking for anyone who might have crossed paths with Palmer.

The problem was context. College was twenty years ago. People changed. Even if Palmer had made an enemy back then, would that person wait two decades to act? And if they did, why now? What triggered it?

Brandon made notes. Possible angles:
- College roommate dispute
- Fraternity incident (Palmer was briefly in Sigma Chi)
- Academic rivalry
- Romantic entanglement

That last one caught his attention. Jennifer had mentioned an ex-girlfriend named Laura, dated in Palmer's twenties, married and moved to Colorado. Nothing suspicious there on the surface, but people killed for less than failed relationships.

He pulled out the list of names Jennifer had given them. Palmer's annual golf weekend friends: Tom Braddock, Rich Stein, and a few others. These were people Palmer had stayed in touch with since college. They might remember more than Jennifer knew.

Brandon checked his watch. Eight-thirty on a Saturday morning. Early but not unreasonably so. He pulled out his phone and dialed the first number.

Tom Braddock answered on the third ring. "Hello?"

"Mr. Braddock, this is Special Agent Brandon Gray with the FBI. I'm investigating the death of Michael Palmer. Do you have a few minutes to talk?"

A pause. "Jesus. Yeah, of course. Mike—God, I still can't believe it."

"I understand you were friends with Mr. Palmer from college."

"Yeah. We met freshman year at Creighton. Stayed in touch ever since. We had this golf thing every year—bunch of us would get together, play a round, catch up."

"When was the last time you saw him?"

"Last August. We did our weekend in Scottsdale. Mike seemed fine. Happy. Talking about some big listing he had coming up." Braddock's voice caught. "He was just... normal, you know? Not like someone who'd end up murdered."

"Mr. Braddock, I need to ask about Mike's college years. Did he have any problems back then? Any disputes, conflicts, anything that might have escalated?"

"Problems? Mike?" Braddock laughed, but it was bitter. "Mike was the most boring guy at Creighton. I mean that in a good way. He studied, he worked, he didn't get into trouble. The rest of us were doing stupid college kid stuff. Mike was already thinking about his career."

"What about relationships? Did he date much?"

"A little. Nothing serious until Laura—wait, what was her last name? Harrison? Hartford? Something like that. They dated junior year, I think. Maybe six months? Then it ended and Mike moved on."

"Do you remember why they broke up?"

"No idea. Mike didn't really talk about it. One day they were together, next day they weren't. College relationships, you know? They don't usually last."

Brandon made notes. "Did Mike stay in touch with Laura after college?"

"Not that I know of. She dropped out, moved away somewhere. West, I think. Mike might have mentioned her once or twice over the years, but just in passing. Like 'oh yeah, I dated this girl Laura in college.' Nothing weird about it."

"What about enemies? Anyone who might have held a grudge against Mike?"

"From college? No way. Mike didn't make enemies. He was too nice for that. Hell, even the guys who were jealous of him—because he always got the best grades, always landed the best internships—even they liked him."

Brandon asked a few more questions, but Braddock had nothing useful. He thanked him and moved on to the next name.

Rich Stein was even less helpful. He remembered Palmer as "solid guy," "good friend," "terrible at golf but kept showing up anyway." No conflicts, no drama, no secrets. Palmer was exactly who he appeared to be: a stable, successful man who'd lived a normal life.

By noon, Brandon had called four of Palmer's college friends. All of them said the same thing. Mike Palmer was boring. Nice, reliable, boring.

Which meant either Palmer had hidden his problems extremely well, or the motive for his murder wasn't something his friends would know about.

Brandon closed his laptop and rubbed his eyes. The hotel room felt claustrophobic. He needed to move, to think.

He grabbed his jacket and headed out. The cold hit him immediately—February in Omaha wasn't much different from February in Minneapolis. Gray sky, frozen ground, wind that cut through clothing. He walked to a coffee shop two blocks from the hotel, ordered another coffee he didn't need, and sat by the window.

His mind kept circling back to the crime scene. Palmer's confusion. That profound sense of not understanding why this was happening.

Brandon had felt it clearly. Palmer died trying to make sense of his murder, and he couldn't. Which suggested either Palmer genuinely didn't know his killer, or he didn't recognize a threat from his past.

The mistaken identity theory made sense in that context. If Palmer was confused because he'd done nothing to deserve this, because he had no enemies, then maybe the killer had simply chosen the wrong target. A different Mike Palmer. A different real estate agent. Someone who *did* have enemies.

But Matt was skeptical, and Brandon's gut agreed. Steven—whoever he really was—had planned too carefully to make that kind of mistake. The mall surveillance evasion, the isolated property, the meticulous staging. That was someone who knew exactly what he was doing.

So if not mistaken identity, then what?

Brandon pulled out his phone and opened the ViCAP files he'd downloaded. Three similar cases over ten years. Real estate professionals killed during property showings. All unsolved.

He read through each case again, looking for connections to Palmer.

Kansas City, 2004. Robert Chen, fifty-three, property manager. Killed in a vacant warehouse he was showing to a potential buyer. Single gunshot to the head. Buyer described as "professional looking," possibly deaf (communicated through writing). Never identified.

Charlotte, 2007. Margaret Riley, forty-six, commercial real estate agent. Found strangled in the basement of a vacant property. Met buyer at the property—no witnesses to the meeting. Buyer described as "distinguished gentleman," possibly blind in one eye (wore dark glasses). Never identified.

Phoenix, 2010. David Ochoa, thirty-eight, residential real estate agent. Found dead in a storage unit he was showing. Blunt force trauma. Buyer used wheelchair, claimed to be relocating from California. Never identified.

Different methods. Different staging. Different disabilities—all likely faked.

But the pattern was there. Professional executions. Isolated locations. Meticulous planning. No apparent motive.

Brandon made notes. Questions:
- Is Steven responsible for all four murders?
- If yes, why target real estate professionals specifically?
- If no, did Steven study these cases to pattern his crime?
- Is Palmer connected to any of the other victims?

He ran searches. Palmer, Chen, Riley, Ochoa. Different cities, different firms, different specialties. No obvious connection.

He tried different angles. Did they attend the same conferences? Belong to the same professional organizations? Work for the same parent companies at different times?

Nothing.

By three PM, Brandon was back in his hotel room, frustrated and exhausted. He'd been working for seven hours and had exactly nothing to show for it.

Palmer's college friends remembered him as a normal guy. The ViCAP victims had no apparent connection to Palmer. The mistaken identity theory was still possible but felt increasingly unlikely.

Brandon's phone buzzed. Text from Matt: *Making any progress?*

Brandon typed back: *Dead ends so far. You?*

*Same. Talked to a few of Palmer's neighbors. All say he was quiet, kept to himself, no problems. Meeting Morrison Monday to review agent list.*

*Copy that.*

Brandon set his phone down and stared at his laptop screen. The crime scene photos were still open. Palmer in the tub, arms at his sides, water running. The staging had been so careful. So deliberate.

Why?

If this was a professional hit, the staging made sense as evidence contamination. But if Steven had studied those other cases to make it *look* like a professional hit, then the staging was misdirection. A way to make Palmer's murder seem like part of a pattern when it was actually personal.

Brandon closed the laptop. His head hurt. His impression at the crime scene had been strong—Palmer's confusion, his fear, his desperate attempt to understand. But strong impressions didn't always mean clear answers.

Maybe he needed to go back. Spend more time there. See if the impression would sharpen with distance from the initial trauma.

Or maybe his ability was just hitting its limits. Maybe Palmer's confusion was all there was to find. Maybe the answer wasn't in Palmer's final moments but in his past, buried so deep that even Palmer himself didn't recognize it as dangerous.

**Sunday, February 3, 2013**

Brandon spent Sunday morning running down another angle: Palmer's father's insurance agency.

Jennifer had mentioned Palmer worked there briefly in his twenties, hated it, left to pursue real estate. It was a long shot—insurance work wasn't exactly the stuff of murder plots—but Brandon was running out of obvious leads.

He found the agency online. Palmer Insurance Services. Sold five years ago when Palmer's father died. Now operating under a different name, different ownership. The original business had been small—maybe a dozen employees, serving local clients in the Omaha area.

Brandon called the current owner, identified himself, asked if they had any records from the Palmer era.

"Some," the woman said. Her name was Carol Hendricks. She sounded tired. "We kept client files for seven years after the sale per the contract. After that, we shredded most of it. Why?"

"I'm investigating the murder of Michael Palmer. He worked at the agency in the early nineties."

"Oh God. I heard about that. Terrible. But I don't know what I can tell you. I never met him. The agency had already been sold and renamed by the time I came on board."

"Did Mr. Palmer's father have any disputes with clients? Denied claims, legal issues, anything that might have created lasting resentment?"

Hendricks was quiet for a moment. "Look, I'm not going to speak ill of the dead, but insurance agencies in the nineties weren't always run by the books. We found some questionable documentation when we did our due diligence. Nothing prosecutable, just... creative interpretations of coverage. But that was before my time. And it was John Palmer's agency, not Mike's. Mike only worked there a couple years."

"Do you remember any specific problems?"

"No. Like I said, it was before my time."

Brandon thanked her and hung up. Another dead end.

He made sandwiches from the hotel breakfast bar leftovers and ate at his desk while reviewing his notes. College friends: nothing. ViCAP connections: nothing. Insurance agency: probably nothing.

The mistaken identity angle was looking more plausible by the hour, even if Matt was skeptical. Morrison's list would give them something concrete to pursue on Monday. Other agents with similar names, similar profiles. Maybe one of them had the enemies Palmer lacked.

But something bothered Brandon about the whole theory. Palmer's confusion at the crime scene wasn't just "why is this happening?" It was deeper than that. More personal. Like he was looking for context that should be there and wasn't.

Brandon pulled up the crime scene photos again. Studied Steven's description from the witnesses. White male, fifties, five-eleven, medium build. Dark coat. Cane with silver handle. Pronounced limp. East Coast accent.

All of it could be faked. Steven could be younger, taller, different build. The accent was easy to fake. The cane and limp were theater. Even the facial scar the witnesses mentioned—makeup, prosthetics.

Who was Steven really?

And why did he want Mike Palmer dead badly enough to plan this elaborately?

Brandon closed his laptop and lay back on the bed. His head ached. The hotel room's ceiling had a water stain in the corner, shaped vaguely like a hand. He stared at it, letting his mind drift.

Palmer's confusion.

That was the key. That was what his impression had given him, clear and undeniable. Palmer had died confused. Not just afraid—confused.

Either he was confused because he was innocent and there was no reason for this to happen to him.

Or he was confused because the context was wrong. Because his killer shouldn't have been there, shouldn't have been *him*, shouldn't have been doing *this*.

Brandon sat up. That second option—that felt right. That matched the depth of Palmer's confusion.

Palmer knew something was wrong about the situation, but he couldn't identify what. Like seeing a familiar face in the wrong place. Or hearing words that didn't match the speaker. Or feeling a threat from someone who shouldn't be threatening.

The context was wrong.

Which meant the killer was someone Palmer knew, or had known, in a completely different context. Not as "Steven the buyer from California." As someone else. Someone from Palmer's past.

But who?

Brandon grabbed his notebook and started listing possibilities:

College acquaintance Palmer barely remembered
Former coworker from insurance agency
Childhood friend from Omaha
Distant relative
Client from Palmer's early real estate days
Fraternity brother from brief stint in Sigma Chi

Any of these could be Steven's real identity. Any of them could have been in Palmer's life twenty or thirty years ago, then disappeared, then returned in disguise.

But why wait so long? What triggered the murder *now*, in January 2013?

Brandon wrote: TRIGGER = ?

Something had changed. Something had happened recently that made Steven decide Palmer needed to die. After years or decades of doing nothing.

- Palmer discovered something Steven wanted hidden?
- Steven suffered a loss and blamed Palmer?
- An old case or crime was being reopened and Palmer was a witness?
- Steven was dying and wanted revenge before it was too late?

All possible. All worth investigating.

Brandon checked his watch. Four-thirty PM on Sunday. Morrison would have her list ready tomorrow morning. They'd spend Monday checking out other real estate agents, pursuing the mistaken identity theory. But Brandon would also push for deeper investigation into Palmer's past. Because his impression was telling him something, even if he couldn't articulate exactly what.

Palmer had known his killer. Or at least, Palmer had known who his killer really was, underneath the disguise. In those final moments, maybe Palmer had recognized something—a voice, a gesture, a phrase. Something that triggered memory.

But by then it was too late.

Brandon closed his notebook. Tomorrow they'd have direction. Either Morrison's list would yield a viable alternative target, confirming mistaken identity. Or it wouldn't, and they'd shift focus to Palmer's hidden past.

Either way, they'd be moving forward instead of spinning in circles.

His phone buzzed. Text from Matt: *Want to grab dinner?*

Brandon typed back: *Yeah. Give me ten minutes.*

He needed to get out of this hotel room. Needed to stop staring at crime scene photos and case files and notes that led nowhere. A few hours of normal conversation over mediocre food sounded perfect.

Tomorrow they'd start fresh. Tomorrow they'd have Morrison's list and new leads to chase. Tomorrow the case would break open.

Or at least, that's what Brandon hoped.

Because right now, three days into this investigation, they had a professional killer who'd disappeared, a victim with no apparent enemies, and two competing theories that both seemed equally plausible and equally wrong.

Somewhere in Omaha, Steven was going about his day. Maybe watching the news, checking to see if they'd figured it out yet. Maybe already planning his next move. Maybe long gone, never to be found.

But he'd left something behind. Brandon knew it. Not just physical evidence—Morrison's team had found what there was to find. Something psychological. Something in the pattern of behavior, the choice of victim, the method of execution.

Steven had planned this murder for a reason. He'd chosen Palmer specifically. He'd waited for the right moment. He'd studied other cases to make his crime look like part of a series.

All of that meant something. All of that told a story, if Brandon could just read it correctly.

His impression at the crime scene had given him one piece: Palmer's confusion. Palmer died not understanding why.

But maybe that was the whole point. Maybe Steven wanted Palmer confused. Wanted him to die the same way Steven had felt when whatever happened between them originally occurred.

If that was true, then this was revenge. Personal, calculated revenge.

And revenge required a personal connection.

Brandon grabbed his jacket and headed for the door. He'd talk this through with Matt over dinner. Matt's logical mind would help organize Brandon's impressions into something actionable.

Tomorrow they'd know more. Tomorrow they'd have a direction.

Tonight, he just needed to stop thinking for a few hours.

The case would still be there in the morning.
