# Chapter Three

**Saturday, February 2, 2013**

Brandon woke to gray light filtering through the Hampton Inn curtains. His phone said seven-fifteen. He'd slept later than expected, but he'd been up past two reviewing Morrison's case files again, looking for something they'd missed.

Matt was still asleep in the next room. They'd agreed to work separately over the weekend. Matt would follow up on some local angles, Brandon would dig into Palmer's background. Morrison's list of agents fitting Palmer's profile wouldn't be ready until Monday, which left the mistaken identity theory in limbo for now.

Brandon showered, dressed, and headed down to the breakfast bar. He filled a travel mug with coffee, grabbed a bagel he'd end up only nibbling at, and returned to his room. His laptop was already open on the desk, tabs from last night still loaded. He settled into the chair and started working.

First: Creighton University.

Palmer had graduated in 1992 with a business degree. Twenty-one years ago. Brandon pulled up the university website, navigated to alumni services, found the registrar contact information. He'd need official records, but those would take time and probably require a warrant. For now, he'd work with what was publicly available.

He searched for "Michael Palmer Creighton University" and found a few hits. An alumni directory listing from 2010. A mention in a business school newsletter about Palmer-Rodriguez Real Estate's tenth anniversary. Nothing substantial.

Brandon tried a different approach. He pulled up LinkedIn, searched for Creighton graduates from 1988-1992. Filtered by business degree. Got several hundred results. Too many to sort through manually, but he started scanning names, looking for anyone who might have crossed paths with Palmer.

The problem was context. College was twenty years ago. People changed. Even if Palmer had made an enemy back then, would that person wait two decades to act? And if they did, why now? What triggered it?

Brandon made notes. Possible angles:
- College roommate dispute
- Fraternity incident (Palmer was briefly in Sigma Chi)
- Academic rivalry
- Romantic entanglement

That last one caught his attention. Jennifer had mentioned an ex-girlfriend named Laura, dated in Palmer's twenties, married and moved to Colorado. Nothing suspicious there on the surface, but people killed for less than failed relationships.

He pulled out the list of names Jennifer had given them. Palmer's annual golf weekend friends: Tom Braddock, Rich Stein, and a few others. These were people Palmer had stayed in touch with since college. They might remember more than Jennifer knew.

Brandon checked his watch. Eight-thirty on a Saturday morning. Early but not unreasonably so. He pulled out his phone and dialed the first number.

Tom Braddock answered on the third ring. "Hello?"

"Mr. Braddock, this is Special Agent Brandon Gray with the FBI. I'm investigating the death of Michael Palmer. Do you have a few minutes to talk?"

A pause. "Jesus. Yeah, of course. Mike—God, I still can't believe it."

"I understand you were friends with Mr. Palmer from college."

"Yeah. We met freshman year at Creighton. Stayed in touch ever since. We had this golf trip every year—bunch of us would get together, play a couple rounds, catch up."

"When was the last time you saw him?"

"Last August. We did our weekend in Scottsdale. Mike seemed fine. Happy. Talking about some big listing he had coming up." Braddock's voice caught. "He was just... normal, you know? Not like someone who'd end up murdered."

"Mr. Braddock, I need to ask about Mike's college years. Did he have any problems back then? Any disputes, conflicts, anything that might have escalated?"

"Problems? Mike?" Braddock laughed, but it was bitter. "Mike was the most boring guy at Creighton. I mean that in a good way. He studied, he worked, he didn't get into trouble. The rest of us were doing stupid college kid stuff. Mike was already thinking about his career."

"What about relationships? Did he date much?"

"A little. Nothing serious until Laura—wait, what was her last name? Harrison? Hartford? Something like that. They dated junior year, I think. Maybe six months? Then it ended and Mike moved on."

"Do you remember why they broke up?"

"No idea. Mike didn't really talk about it. One day they were together, next day they weren't. College relationships, you know? They don't usually last."

Brandon made notes. "Did Mike stay in touch with Laura after college?"

"Not that I know of. She dropped out, moved away somewhere. West, I think. Mike might have mentioned her once or twice over the years, but just in passing. Like 'oh yeah, I dated this girl Laura in college.' Nothing weird about it."

"What about enemies? Anyone who might have held a grudge against Mike?"

"From college? No way. Mike didn't make enemies. He was too nice for that. Hell, even the guys who were jealous of him—because he always got the best grades, always landed the best internships—even they liked him."

Brandon asked a few more questions, but Braddock had nothing useful. He thanked him and moved on to the next name.

Rich Stein was even less helpful. He remembered Palmer as "solid guy," "good friend," "terrible at golf but kept showing up anyway." No conflicts, no drama, no secrets. Palmer was exactly who he appeared to be: a stable, successful man who'd lived a normal life.

By noon, Brandon had called four of Palmer's college friends. All of them said the same thing. Mike Palmer was boring. Nice, reliable, boring.

Which meant either Palmer had hidden his problems extremely well, or the motive for his murder wasn't something his friends would know about.

Brandon closed his laptop and rubbed his eyes. The hotel room felt claustrophobic. He needed to move, to think.

He grabbed his jacket and headed out. The cold hit him immediately—February in Omaha wasn't much different from February in Minneapolis. Gray sky, frozen ground, wind that cut through clothing. He walked to a coffee shop two blocks from the hotel, ordered another coffee he didn't need, and sat by the window.

His mind kept circling back to the crime scene. Palmer's confusion. That profound sense of not understanding why this was happening.

Brandon had felt it clearly. Palmer died trying to make sense of his murder, and he couldn't. Which suggested either Palmer genuinely didn't know his killer, or he didn't recognize a threat from his past.

The mistaken identity theory made sense in that context. If Palmer was confused because he'd done nothing to deserve this, because he had no enemies, then maybe the killer had simply chosen the wrong target. A different Mike Palmer. A different real estate agent. Someone who *did* have enemies.

But Matt was skeptical, and Brandon's gut agreed. Steven—whoever he really was—had planned too carefully to make that kind of mistake. The mall surveillance evasion, the isolated property, the meticulous staging. That was someone who knew exactly what he was doing.

So if not mistaken identity, then what?

Brandon pulled out his phone and opened the ViCAP files he'd downloaded. Three similar cases over ten years. Real estate professionals killed during property showings. All unsolved.

He read through each case again, looking for connections to Palmer.

Kansas City, 2004. Robert Chen, fifty-three, property manager. Killed in a vacant warehouse he was showing to a potential buyer. Single gunshot to the head. Buyer described as "professional looking," possibly deaf (communicated through writing). Never identified.

Charlotte, 2007. Margaret Riley, forty-six, commercial real estate agent. Found strangled in the basement of a vacant property. Met buyer at the property—no witnesses to the meeting. Buyer described as "distinguished gentleman," possibly blind in one eye (wore dark glasses). Never identified.

Phoenix, 2010. David Ochoa, thirty-eight, residential real estate agent. Found dead in a townhouse he was showing. Blunt force trauma. Buyer used wheelchair, claimed to be relocating from California. Never identified.

Different methods. Different staging. Different disabilities—all likely faked.

But the pattern was there. Professional executions. Isolated locations. Meticulous planning. No apparent motive.

Brandon made notes. Questions:
- Is Steven responsible for all four murders?
- If yes, why target real estate professionals specifically?
- If no, did Steven study these cases to pattern his crime?
- Is Palmer connected to any of the other victims?

He ran searches. Palmer, Chen, Riley, Ochoa. Different cities, different firms, different specialties. No obvious connection.

He tried different angles. Did they attend the same conferences? Belong to the same professional organizations? Work for the same parent companies at different times?

Nothing.

By three PM, Brandon was back in his hotel room, frustrated and exhausted. He'd been working for seven hours and had exactly nothing to show for it.

Palmer's college friends remembered him as a normal guy. The ViCAP victims had no apparent connection to Palmer. The mistaken identity theory was still possible but felt increasingly unlikely.

Brandon's phone buzzed. Text from Matt: *Making any progress?*

Brandon typed back: *Dead ends so far. You?*

*Same. Talked to a few of Palmer's neighbors. All say he was quiet, kept to himself, no problems. Meeting Morrison Monday to review agent list.*

*Copy that.*

Brandon set his phone down and stared at his laptop screen. The crime scene photos were still open. Palmer in the tub, arms at his sides, water running. The staging had been so careful. So deliberate.

Why?

If this was a professional hit, the staging made sense as evidence contamination. But if Steven had studied those other cases to make it *look* like a professional hit, then the staging was misdirection. A way to make Palmer's murder seem like part of a pattern when it was actually personal.

Brandon closed the laptop. His head hurt. His impression at the crime scene had been strong—Palmer's confusion, his fear, his desperate attempt to understand. But strong impressions didn't always mean clear answers.

Maybe he needed to go back. Spend more time there. See if the impression would sharpen with distance from the initial trauma.

Or maybe his ability was just hitting its limits. Maybe Palmer's confusion was all there was to find. Maybe the answer wasn't in Palmer's final moments but in his past, buried so deep that even Palmer himself didn't recognize it as dangerous.

**Sunday, February 3, 2013**

Brandon spent Sunday morning running down another angle: Palmer's father's insurance agency.

Jennifer had mentioned Palmer worked there briefly in his twenties, hated it, left to pursue real estate. It was a long shot—insurance work wasn't exactly the stuff of murder plots—but Brandon was running out of obvious leads.

He found the agency online. Palmer Insurance Services. Sold five years ago when Palmer's father died. Now operating under a different name, different ownership. The original business had been small—maybe a dozen employees, serving local clients in the Omaha area.

Brandon called the current owner, identified himself, asked if they had any records from the Palmer era.

"Some," the woman said. Her name was Carol Hendricks. She sounded tired. "We kept client files for seven years after the sale per the contract. After that, we shredded most of it. Why?"

"I'm investigating the murder of Michael Palmer. He worked at the agency in the early nineties."

"Oh God. I heard about that. Terrible. But I don't know what I can tell you. I never met him. The agency had already been sold and renamed by the time I came on board."

"Did Mr. Palmer's father have any disputes with clients? Denied claims, legal issues, anything that might have created lasting resentment?"

Hendricks was quiet for a moment. "Look, I'm not going to speak ill of the dead, but insurance agencies in the nineties weren't always run by the books. We found some questionable documentation when we did our due diligence. Nothing prosecutable, just... creative interpretations of coverage. But that was before my time. And it was John Palmer's agency, not Mike's. Mike only worked there a couple years."

"Do you remember any specific problems?"

"No. Like I said, it was before my time."

Brandon thanked her and hung up. Another dead end.

He made sandwiches from the hotel breakfast bar leftovers and ate at his desk while reviewing his notes. College friends: nothing. ViCAP connections: nothing. Insurance agency: probably nothing.

By mid-afternoon, Brandon had exhausted the obvious angles. He leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling. The water stain in the corner looked like a hand reaching for something just out of reach.

That's how this case felt. Like something was there, just beyond his grasp, but he couldn't quite reach it.

Palmer's confusion kept echoing in his mind. That profound sense of not understanding. But confusion didn't give Brandon direction. It didn't tell him who, or why, or how to find Steven.

Maybe his impression had been too scattered. Maybe he'd misread it entirely. Maybe Palmer's confusion was just the normal response to being murdered—anyone would be confused in that situation.

Brandon pulled out his phone and scrolled through his notes from the crime scene. He'd written down everything he'd felt, every impression that had come through. Palmer's fear. His pain. His desperate attempt to make sense of what was happening.

But that was it. Nothing about the killer. Nothing about motive. Nothing actionable.

In the Carpenter case last year, Brandon's impressions had been clearer. He'd felt Sarah Carpenter's fear of someone she knew. He'd sensed the betrayal, the wrongness of authority turned predator. Those impressions had pointed them toward law enforcement, toward someone in a position of trust.

But Palmer? Palmer just felt confused.

Which supported the mistaken identity theory, actually. If Palmer died confused because he genuinely had no idea why anyone would want him dead, then maybe it was because no one did want *him* dead. Maybe Steven had killed the wrong man.

Brandon's phone buzzed. Text from Matt: *Want to grab dinner?*

Brandon typed back: *Yeah. Give me ten minutes.*

He closed his laptop and stood, stretching. Two days of work and he had nothing useful. Tomorrow Morrison would have the list of similar-named agents. Maybe one of them would be the real target. Maybe this whole weekend had been chasing ghosts while the answer was something as simple as a name mix-up.

Brandon grabbed his jacket and headed for the door. He needed food and conversation that wasn't about the case. His brain needed a break.

---

They met at a steakhouse three blocks from the hotel. The place was half-empty on a Sunday evening—just a few other tables occupied by couples and families finishing weekend dinners.

Matt already had a booth in the back. He was reading something on his phone when Brandon slid in across from him.

"Any luck?" Matt asked, setting his phone aside.

"No. You?"

"Same. Palmer's neighbors all say he was quiet, kept to himself. No complaints, no problems, nobody remembers anything unusual. The guy lived an invisible life."

The waitress came by. They ordered steaks and beer. When she left, Matt leaned back in the booth.

"So we're betting on Morrison's list tomorrow."

"Looks that way," Brandon said. "Unless you've got another angle."

"I've been thinking about the timing. Palmer was killed on January ninth. Three weeks ago. What happened in Steven's life around then that made him decide to act?"

"Could be anything. Job loss, divorce, terminal diagnosis. Or maybe he'd been planning it for months and January ninth was just when the pieces fell into place."

"Maybe." Matt didn't sound convinced. "But professional hits usually have triggers. Something happens that makes the client say 'now.' We just need to figure out what that was."

Brandon took a drink of water. "What if there is no client? What if Steven is just someone who kills real estate agents? Those three ViCAP cases—same pattern, different cities, spanning ten years. Maybe we're looking at a serial killer with a very specific victim type."

"Then why Omaha? Why Palmer specifically? Serial killers usually have a hunting ground. They don't jump from Kansas City to Charlotte to Phoenix to Omaha over ten years."

"True."

The food arrived. They ate in silence for a few minutes. Brandon's mind kept circling back to Palmer's confusion, but he didn't mention it. What was there to say? Palmer was confused, and now they were too.

"You going back to the crime scene?" Matt asked.

Brandon looked up. "What?"

"The Whitmore property. You spent fifteen minutes there on Friday. That's not much time. Maybe you should go back, spend longer. See if anything else comes through."

"Maybe." Brandon had been thinking the same thing, but he wasn't sure it would help. His impressions didn't always get clearer with time. Sometimes they just got louder without being more specific.

"I mean, your impression gave us the mistaken identity theory," Matt said. "Palmer's confusion makes sense if he was the wrong target. So that's something."

Brandon nodded, but he wasn't convinced. The mistaken identity theory felt right logically, but something about it bothered him. Palmer's confusion had felt too deep for simple wrong-place-wrong-time. It had felt personal somehow, even though that made no sense.

But he couldn't explain that to Matt without sounding like he was overthinking his own impressions. So he just said, "Yeah. Morrison's list should tell us if we're on the right track."

They finished dinner and walked back to the hotel. The temperature had dropped into the teens. Their breath fogged in the air. Omaha was quiet on a Sunday night—minimal traffic, a few pedestrians hurrying between warm buildings.

Back in his room, Brandon tried to sleep but couldn't. His mind kept running through the weekend's dead ends. Palmer's college friends remembered nothing useful. The ViCAP cases had no obvious connection. The insurance agency was a long shot that hadn't panned out.

Tomorrow they'd have Morrison's list. Tomorrow they'd interview other agents, look for someone with real enemies. Tomorrow the case might actually move forward.

But tonight, lying in the dark staring at the ceiling, Brandon couldn't shake the feeling that they were missing something. Something important.

Palmer's confusion meant something. It had to. Brandon's impressions weren't perfect, but they weren't usually completely wrong either.

He just couldn't figure out what it meant.

Eventually, exhaustion won. Brandon fell asleep still thinking about Palmer's final moments, still trying to understand what the confusion was trying to tell him.
