# Outline and Notes

## Matt-Driven Investigation
**This is crucial.** Book 1 established Brandon's abilities. Book 2 needs to show:
- The partnership is balanced, not "Brandon is psychic, Matt just drives"
- Matt's experience, procedure, and traditional detective work are equally valuable
- Brandon's abilities have limits/don't always provide clear answers
- Sometimes you solve cases the old-fashioned way

This also raises stakes differently - if Brandon can't "feel" the answer, they have to work harder.

## Male Victim, Straight Murder
Good differentiation from Book 1. Changes:
- Different victim psychology to explore
- Different family dynamics (father, brothers, male friends vs. mother, female relationships)
- Different crime scene impression for Brandon (masculine energy, different trauma)
- No "where is she?" suspense - just "who did this and why?"

## Mike Emert Case
I'm familiar with the broad strokes but not deeply versed in the details. **Can you give me a summary of the key elements you remember from the UM episode?** Specifically:
- Victim profile (age, occupation, personality)
- Circumstances of death (where found, how killed)
- The mystery elements (who might have done it, theories)
- What made it compelling/unsolvable

Then I can help you adapt it for Matt and Brandon while changing enough to make it your own.

## POV Structure Flip
**Perfect.** So Book 2 would be:
- Prologue (non-POV): Crime scene or discovery
- Chapter 1: Brandon POV (odd)
- Chapter 2: Matt POV (even)
- Chapter 3: Brandon POV (odd)
- [continues alternating]
- Final chapter before epilogue: Matt POV (even)
- Epilogue (non-POV): Transition to next case

This puts the spotlight on Matt's process in that crucial final chapter, mirroring how Book 1 spotlighted Brandon.

## Brandon's Limitation (Corrected)

**Much better approach:** Brandon senses the victim's final moments - fear, confusion, betrayal - but gets nothing actionable because:
- Victim doesn't know "Steven" 
- No shared history to tap into
- No motive visible in the victim's mind (because victim doesn't know why this is happening)
- Brandon knows HOW (stabbed, bathtub) and WHO (stranger with distinctive feature) but that's already obvious from the scene

**The mid-book return** is brilliant character development:
- Shows active use of abilities vs. passive reception
- Demonstrates growth without making him overpowered  
- Could be triggered by frustration (case stalling, Matt hitting dead ends)
- Second visit yields something about *victim's state of mind* that reveals hidden context
- Maybe victim realized something in final moments? Recognized something about "Steven"? Made a connection too late?

## Location: Omaha or Lincoln

**I vote Omaha (470K)** for these reasons:
- Big enough for professional hitman scenario to feel plausible
- Still distinctly Midwest (not Chicago/Minneapolis metro sprawl)
- Has suburbs/development areas for real estate angle
- Multiple jurisdictions (Omaha PD, Douglas County, surrounding areas)
- Rich in UM nostalgia for Midwest viewers
- River location (Missouri River) adds geographic texture

**Lincoln works too** (290K, state capital) but Omaha feels grittier, more crime-appropriate.

## Physical Identifier

Needs to be:
- Memorable enough that witnesses recall it
- Distinctive enough that Matt/Brandon recognize him on sight
- But plausible as disguise for a professional

**Options:**
1. **Severe facial scar** (knife or burn) - hard to hide, memorable
2. **Milky/damaged eye** - distinctive, suggests past violence
3. **Missing fingers on one hand** - visible when shaking hands/signing papers
4. **Pronounced Eastern European accent** (voice not appearance)
5. **Unusually tall** (6'5"+) - can't disguise height

**My recommendation:** Facial scar + accent combo. Gives multiple witness touchpoints.

## Timeline & Local PD Partnership

**3-4 weeks since murder** feels right:
- Local PD has worked obvious angles (spouse, business partners, enemies)
- All alibis check out, financials clean, no threats, no motive
- Dead end on "Steven" despite mall security footage
- FBI requested because: professional hit + no motive = organized crime/federal angle?

**Local detective partnership:**
- Detective works with them daily (not just coordinating like Dunham)
- Maybe assigned as their local liaison/partner
- Rides along on interviews, shares theories, has own investigative style
- Creates buddy-cop dynamic alongside Matt/Brandon partnership
- Different than Book 1's structure

**Character sketch for local detective:**
- 15-20 years experience, seen plenty of murders
- Initially skeptical of FBI involvement ("we can handle our own")
- Gradually respects their methods (especially Matt's thoroughness)
- Doesn't know about Brandon's abilities (Matt/Brandon keep that between them)
- Provides local knowledge, connections, street-level intel

## Mistaken Identity Angle

**This could be a mid-book red herring:**
- Matt pursues theory: wrong target, hitman got wrong person
- Investigates people with similar names, same development, lookalike victims
- Seems promising, but ultimately wrong
- Real answer: victim WAS the target, but for reasons hidden deep in past

## Mistaken Identity as Brandon's Red Herring

**This works perfectly:**
- Brandon's first crime scene read: victim's confusion/fear suggests "he thought this was about someone else" or "wrong place, wrong time feeling"
- Brandon proposes mistaken identity theory
- Matt pursues it methodically (because that's what partners do)
- Mid-book: Brandon returns to scene, digs deeper, realizes he misread the victim's confusion
- The confusion wasn't "why me?" but "I don't understand why THIS thing from my past matters now"
- Brandon corrects course, admits his mistake, they pivot

**This keeps it Matt-centric because:**
- Matt does all the legwork on the wrong-target theory (interviews, backgrounds, comparisons)
- Shows Matt's thoroughness even when pursuing wrong lead
- When theory collapses, Matt's the one who pieces together the real motive
- Brandon provides course correction, but Matt drives to solution

## Local Detective Integration

**I like your approach. Here's how to execute it:**

**First interjection (unhelpful but not stupid):**
- Context: Matt and Brandon are discussing timeline/logistics
- Detective suggests checking a lead they've already eliminated
- Not wrong per se, just... already covered
- Matt politely explains they've ruled it out
- Moment of awkwardness, detective backs off
- Shows he's not in sync yet, but not incompetent

**Second interjection (genuinely helpful):**
- Context: Matt and Brandon hitting a wall on something
- Detective offers local knowledge/connection they wouldn't have
- "Wait, I know someone who worked with the victim in the 90s..."
- Actually unlocks something
- Matt and Brandon exchange a look: okay, he's useful
- Earns his place in the investigation

**Name/sketch for detective:**
- Detective Ray Vasquez or Detective Claire Morrison?
- 15 years Omaha PD, Homicide
- Seen plenty of murders but nothing this calculated
- Initially protective of "his" case
- Gradually becomes genuine team member

## Matt as Lost Brother Figure

**Show this evolution through:**

**Small moments, not declarations:**
- Matt brings Brandon coffee without asking (knows his patterns)
- "You eat today?" check-ins that Brandon accepts instead of deflecting
- Matt mentions his own family, asks about Brandon's brother naturally
- Brandon actually answers (growth from Book 1's evasiveness)
- Comfortable silences in the car
- Matt advocating for Brandon to take breaks/rest

**One key scene idea:**
Brandon mentions Tom (his brother) in passing, something about still searching. Matt doesn't push but says something like "You know you can talk about it if you need to." Brandon says "I know" and actually means it. That's all. No big moment, just acknowledgment that the door is open and Brandon feels safe.

**Avoid:**
- Explicit "you're like a brother to me" statements
- Overly emotional moments
- Brandon suddenly being demonstrative
- Matt being paternalistic/condescending

You're absolutely right - I way overused Chen in Book 1. My apologies. Let me fix that.

## Prologue & First Chapters Outline (Revised)

### **PROLOGUE (Non-POV, Present Tense)**

**Setting:** January 2013, Omaha, Nebraska, around 1:00 PM

**Structure:**
1. Homeowner returns to check on property (new construction showing)
2. Notices real estate agent's Lexus still in driveway (strange - showing should be over)
3. Front door slightly ajar
4. Enters cautiously, calls out
5. Finds blood trail leading upstairs
6. Bathroom: victim in tub, shower running, multiple stab wounds
7. Victim's expensive watch and wedding ring missing from body
8. 911 call

**Tone:** Clinical, procedural, building dread. Focus on details that will matter later.

**End:** First responders arrive, scene is chaos, but it's clear this wasn't random.

**Opening:**
- Modern police headquarters, much bigger than Parke County
- Detective Claire Morrison waiting in conference room
- Late 30s, sharp suit, murder book already organized on table
- Brandon notices immediately: she's prepared, professional, no-nonsense

**Scene 1: Initial Meeting**
- Morrison stands, firm handshake: "Agents. Claire Morrison, Homicide."
- Matt: "Matt Ellis. Brandon Gray. Thanks for coordinating with us."
- Morrison: "Let's be clear up front - I requested FBI assistance. This isn't about jurisdiction or ego. This case needs fresh eyes and federal resources."
- Brandon notes: Direct. Confident. Knows what she needs.
- Morrison walks them through her investigation - it's thorough, methodical
- Wife and business partner vetted extensively, cleared
- Financial deep-dive: nothing suspicious
- Background checks: no enemies, no threats, no debts
- Victim was well-regarded, successful, stable marriage, no vices

- Morrison: "Whoever did this knew what they were doing. And I've hit every wall there is."

**Scene 2: Brandon Studies Crime Scene Photos**

- Victim was confused, not just afraid
- Like he didn't understand why this was happening

**Scene 3: First Theory**
- Brandon: "Detective, did you consider the possibility this was the wrong victim?"
- Morrison pauses, considers: "Mistaken identity? We looked at similar names, same development. Nothing jumped out. Why?"
- Brandon: "Something about the victim's... state. Like this didn't make sense to him."
- Morrison: "That's interesting. Most victims are confused when they're being murdered."
- Brandon: "Not confused about dying. Confused about *why*."
- Matt: "Worth exploring. Could explain the lack of obvious motive."
- Morrison nods: "All right. I'll pull similar cases, comparable victims. We can review tomorrow."
- Then: "But first - you want to see the actual scene, don't you Agent Gray?"
- Brandon looks at her: She's sharp. Picked up on it.
- Brandon: "Yes."
- Morrison: "I'll get us access. Tomorrow morning, 9 AM. Property's been released but owner's cooperative."

**End:** They check into hotel. Tomorrow they visit the scene. Brandon's already feeling the weight of what they'll find there.

## Detective Morrison Character Notes:

**Establishing Competence:**
- She requested FBI help (proactive, knows her limits)
- Her investigation is thorough and well-documented
- She's direct about what she needs, not defensive
- Treats Matt and Brandon as colleagues, not threats
- Picks up on Brandon's need to visit the scene without being told
- No flirting, no "female detective trying to prove herself" clichés
- Just a good detective who wants to solve a murder
